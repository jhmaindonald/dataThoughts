## Covid-19 deaths --- comparing countries

```

United States data for the 13 months up to 31 January 2021 shows
a stark difference in death rates, for those in younger as 
compared with those in older age groups, as shown in Figure 
\@ref(fig:riskByAge).

```{r rates, echo=FALSE}
ltge65 <- with(USdeadpop1yr, c("<65"=sum(covdeaths[age<65])/sum(pop[age<65]),
                              ">=65"=sum(covdeaths[age>=65])/sum(pop[age>=65])))
```

Clearly, more deaths are to expected, assuming a similar
breakdown by age, in countries with relatively more old people. The US
death rates per 1000 for Covid-19, for under age 65 as opposed to age $>=$ 65, were `r round(1000*ltge65,2)`

Countries with a lower proportion of their population aged >=65 
would, if the death rates for each of the two groups are similar,
have lower overall death rates.  The following compares the
overall deaths rates for the US with what might, if these figures
carried across, be expected for Kenya and for Italy.
 
```{r ov65, echo=FALSE}
us65plus <- with(USdeadpop1yr, sum(pop[age>=65])/sum(pop))
it65plus <- with(italyPop5s, sum((M+F)[Age>=65])/sum(M+F))
ke65plus <- with(kenyaPop5s, sum((M+F)[Age>=65])/sum(M+F))
deathsPer100K <- rbind("Percentage 65 or more"= 100*c(US=us65plus, Italy=it65plus,Kenya=ke65plus),
                       "Expected deaths per 100,000"=100000*c(ltge65[1]*(1-c(us65plus, it65plus, ke65plus))+
                                                              ltge65[2]*c(us65plus, it65plus, ke65plus)),
                       "Reported deaths per 100,000"=100000*cf3countries[,3]/cf3countries[,2])
deathsPer100K[3,1] <- 100000*with(USdeadpop1yr, sum(covdeaths)/sum(pop))
round(deathsPer100K,1)
```
Italy has a higher proportion of older people, leading to a higher 
expected death-rate.  Kenya has a much lower proportion, and a lower 
expected overall death-rate.  Other US totals, e.g., for infection rates 
or hospital admissions, while still impacted by age structure, were not
impacted to the same extent.  A table on the US Center for Disease 
Control web page^[Hospitalization and Death by Age <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html>]
shows how, in the US, hospitalization and death varied with
age.  Whereas death rates for those 85 years of age or older were
810 times those of 5-17 year olds, for hospitalization the multiplier
was 52. The rates for 0-4 year olds were around twice those for
5-17 year olds. Overall rates varied, in both cases, with ethnicity.

Between country comparisons are hazardous.  There are likely to be
differences in the completeness of the data and in recording protocols.
The dependence of reported case numbers on testing rates makes it
likely that they will be substantial undercounts, to an extent that 
varies from country to country.

## A paradox of human intuition 

The Yule-Simpson paradox, as it is called, commonly
arises when weighting effects that are present in the
data operate with respect to two or more 
factors.^[The website <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDinnCwP3dg> 
has an animated video that provides a short overview of the paradox]


University of California Berkeley (UCB) 
1973 admissions data for the six largest departments, 
summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:UCBgph1), provides an example.
Admission rates varied by department, as did the relative 
numbers of males and females applying, in ways that led to the 
paradox. Male/female differences within departments were of
lesser consequence.

Overall admission rates across the six largest departments were: 

```{r byGender}
## Tabulate by Admit and Gender
byGender <- margin.table(UCBAdmissions, margin=1:2)
round(100*prop.table(byGender, margin=2)["Admitted", ], 1)
```

Taken at face value, these numbers suggest discrimination 
against females,  

```{r cap6, echo=FALSE}
cap6 <- "UCB admossion data for 1973, accounting for male/female differences, by department.  Department labels range from A to E."
```

```{r UCBgph1, fig.width=6, fig.asp=0.68, fig.pos='H', out.width="72%", fig.cap=cap6}

par(oldpar)
```

Admission rates for males and females, by department, tell a different 
story.  Percentages are given, with totals who applied shown underneath.

```{r admitrates, comment=NA}
library(kableExtra)
admit <- round(100*prop.table(UCBAdmissions,
                     margin=2:3)["Admitted", , ], 1)
tots <- margin.table(UCBAdmissions, margin=2:3)
totals <- matrix(paste0('(',tots,')'),nrow=2)
admit <- rbind(admit, totals)[c(1,3,2,4),]
## tab <- xtable::xtable(admit, digits=1)
## print(tab, type='latex', comment=FALSE, floating=FALSE, scalebox=0.9)
print(admit, quote=F, right=T)
```
The biggest differences in admission rates were in departments
A (82.4%-62.1%=20.3%) and B (68%-63%=5%), in both cases favouring females.
In the other four departments, differences were 3.8% or less.

In order to understand how this happens, it is necessary to look
at how the numbers that applied break down by gender and by department:
Comparing departments A and B with other departments, one finds:
```{r ABvsCDEF, echo=FALSE}
tab <- t(apply(tots, 1, function(x)c("AB"=sum(x[1:2]),"CDEF"=sum(x[4:6]))))
names(dimnames(tab)) <- rep("",2)
mat <- matrix(paste(tab, c("(62.1,63%)", "(82.4,68%)", 
                           "(5.9 to 36.9%)", "(7.0 to 34.9%)")), 
       ncol=2, dimnames=dimnames(tab))
print(mat, quote=FALSE, right=TRUE)
```

* Overall admission rates for males are weighted (1385:981) towards
male rates of 62.1% or 63% in departments A and B.
* Those for females are strongly weighted (1109:133) towards admission rates that range from 5.9% to 34.1% in departments C to F.

### A note on Lord's paradox {-}

The same sorts of paradoxical effects can be found in regression.
The Yule-Simpson paradox may be regarded as a special case of Lord's
paradox, described in @lord1967paradox. Any attempt to attach meaning
to regression coefficients can be highly misleading, unless one can be
sure that effects of all relevant variables are properly 
accounted for.  It is rarely easy, with observational data, to be sure 
that this has been done effectively.

Researchers were comparing two
analgesic treatments, without and with baclofen. When the paper was
first submitted for publication, an alert reviewer spotted that some
of the treatment groups contained more women than men, and asked
whether this might account for the
results.\footnote{Cohen, P. 1996. Pain discriminates between the
sexes.  New Scientist, 2 November, p. 16.}

For a fair overall comparison:

* Calculate means for each subgroup separately.
* Overall treatment effect is average of subgroup differences.

The effect of baclofen (reduction in pain score from time 0) is then:

* Females: 3.479 - 4.151 = -0.672 (-ve, therefore an increase)
* Males: 1.311 - 1.647 = -0.336
* Average, male \& female = -0.5 $\times$ (0.672+0.336) = -0.504

### Web page revenue per click {-}

In 2010 a US Internet company collected data that compared the effectiveness
of a 1-click strategy where an advert appeared on the website's first page,
and a 2-click strategy, where a click on a keyword sends user to page with 
the advert.  The response (total amount of purchases in millions of dollars)
was compared between the two.  RP1000 is revenue per thousand users.
[@smith-sd, p.111]

1-click   |         |   |     | 2-click |  |
---| ------- | -----   | --- | -- | ------- | ------- | ---
   | Revenue | Users   | RP1000 |    | Revenue | Users   | RP1000
  | $2.9   | 250  |$11.60 |   | $1.7 | 140  | $12.14

Now break the data down, looking separately at US and International users.
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r r r r}
& \multicolumn{3}{l}{1-click} & & \multicolumn{3}{l}{2-click}\\
Location   & Revenue & Users   & RP1000 && Revenue & Users & RP1000\\
US & \$1.8   & \textcolor{red}{70}  &\$27.71 && \$1.2 & \textcolor{red}{50}  & \$24.00\\
Int. & \$1.1   & \textcolor{red}{180} &\$6.11  && \$0.50 & \textcolor{red}{90} & \$5.56\\
& \multicolumn{3}{c}{$\frac{180}{70}$=\textcolor{red}{2.57}} & & \multicolumn{3}{c}{$\frac{90}{50}$=\textcolor{red}{1.8}}\\
\end{tabular}

The overall figure is dominated by the result for the 180,000 international
(as opposed to the 70,000 US) users in the 1-click sample.

This was followed up with a randomized experiment (an A/B test), where
the probability of assignment to 1-click, as opposed to 2-click, was
the same for both classes of user.

## Epistatic effects on genetic studies

In population genetics, Simpson's paradox type effects are known as
epistasis.  Most human societies are genetically heterogeneous.  In
San Francisco, any gene that is different between the European and
Chinese populations will be found to be associated with the use of
chopsticks!  If a disease differs in frequency between the European
and Chinese populations, then a naive analysis will find an
association between that disease and any gene that differs in
frequency between the European and Chinese populations.

Such effects are major issues for gene/disease population
association studies.  It is now common to collect genetic
fingerprinting data that should identify major heterogeneity.
Providing such differences are accounted for, large effects that show
up in large studies are likely to be real.  Small effects may well be
epistatic.
