# Overview {#overview}

Issues and questions that appear repeatedly are:

1. Understand the psychology  --- why the showcase of fallacies
    +  An understanding of the mental traps to which we are prone
    can help us avoid them.   
2. Graphs can reveal surprises. They can also be drawn 
so that they deceive.  Take care!  
3. What is the cause?  What should we blame, or praise?
    + What causes cholera – bad air or bad water? 
    + Does drinking coffee help or harm health?  
4. Randomized trials, if done rigorously, are a gold standard.
Participants must closely reflect the population to which
results will be applied.  
5. Population studies, where covariate adjustments are needed 
to account for prior differences between the two (or more)
groups, much more readily mislead?  
6. From hindsight to insight --- it's easy to be deceived.
    + If a sportsperson is at the top of their form, the only 
way to go is down. If at the bottom, the only way is up.
    + This is true also for success in business.
    + Chance, as well as form, obviously plays a part.  
7. The Yule-Simpson paradox appears in many different guises.
It arises from what are really weighting effects, because we
have naively added numbers in ways that give more weight to 
some combinations of effects more than to others.  
8. Tall fathers are likely to have tall sons, but shorter than themselves. 
Tall sons are likely to have tall fathers, but shorter than themselves.
This is an example of regression to the mean.  What may seem puzzling
is that it goes in both directions, from sons to fathers as well as from
fathers to sons.  
9. Results become part of established science when they have
survived informed critique. Work that claims to revise or overturn
established results has itself to survive the same informed critique.
    + There is a great deal of uninformed critique.  Watch for the 
tricks that are used in the attempt to discredit established
scientific results that detractors find inconvenient.  
10. Publication processes, widely across many areas of science,
urgently require to be updated.
    + They work well where the nature of the work requires input
    and critique widely from across different disciplinary 
    perspectives.
    + When presented with scientific (or any) claims, ask/check
    whether claims have been carefully critiqued.  For laboratory
    studies, have results been replicated?

### A simple (and, arguably, trick) example {-}

Linda is a 31-year old philosophy graduate, single,
outspoken, and bright.  As a student, she was deeply
concerned with issues of discrimination and social
justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear
demonstrations.  Which of the following is more probable?  

* Linda is a bank teller.
* Linda is a bank teller, and active in the feminist
movement.

Adding the further descriptor "active in the feminist
movement" can only lower the probability, or just possibly
leave it unchanged.  Instead of assessing the balance of
probabilities, we are tempted to ask which description best
meshes with what we have been already told about Linda.

"Linda is active in the feminist movement" is the single 
descriptor" that respondents see as best fitting Linda.
While that was not what was asked, one has to pay close
attention to prevent System 1 from substituting that for
the question that was asked.  Note that the correct 
answer will be "a bank teller", irrespective of the way 
that Linda was characterized before the question was asked.
