# Human judgment --- two systems

An understanding of the mental traps to which we are prone
can help us avoid them. 
System 1 (jumping) and System 2 (pondering) provide helpful 
models (one may call them "fictions"), for understanding how 
humans think.  
* System 1 (jumping quickly to a conclusion) responds quickly to 
immediate dangers, but is prey to
    priming (suggestive language), framing (response to a choice
    depends on how it is presented), affect (feeling or emotion),
    memory illusions, illusions of truth, ...
* System 1 may answer an easier question in place of a harder.
* System 2 is the process involved when, before making a decision,
we think carefully through the issues involved.
    + Invoke System 2, when time allows, for decisions that matter.  
* System 1 and System 2 are both amenable to training
* A well-trained System 2 is the key to a better System 1

Further points are  
* Untrained humans are poor intuitive statisticians.
     + Too often, we jump to conclusions, without careful assessment.
     + Or, we may not be equipped to make an informed and carefully
     thought through decision.
* System 1 and System 2 are both amenable to training
    + A well-trained System 2 is the key to a better System 1.  
[Kahneman: Ch 1; Smith: Ch 1; Nisbett Ch 1-3]

## The Intuition of Professionals (Kahneman, p. 12)

> The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer.  Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.  
[@simon1992explanation, "What is an Explanation of Behavior?"]

Simon's comments were in part based on the study of chess masters.

> ... An expert is one who has built a deep familiarity with the patterns of a given domain and, thus, has a robust body of work from which to reference when making decisions.^[

### Obstacles to effective judgment {-}

Effective professional training is designed to ensure that at least
some of the results of well-tuned System 2 expert judgment operate
at a System 1 level.  The biases that Kahneman documents can readily
take over, where there should be carefully reasoned System 2 judgment.

* Financial firm executive, explaining why he invested in Ford stock:  
    + "Boy, do they know how to make a car!"
    + An easier and related question (do I like Ford cars?) came
    readily to mind and determined his choice.
* Exemplifies the _affect_ heuristic --- decisions are guided
by like/dislike feelings, with little deliberation or reasoning.

Even those who are experts in their field can be similarly prone to judgments
that have no foundation in fact:

> "But you're not an MD like I am. The problem with you is that you
do not understand medicine.  You see, medical statistics are not
like other statistics."  
[Prostate biopsy specialist, in response to evidence that screening
is counterproductive. [@levitin_2015, p.247]]

Association of Professional Psychologists, web post on 
@arkes2012psychological, discussing the response to a
U.S. Preventive Services assessment that prostate screening,
when used in accordance with then current treatment practices,
was doing more harm than good ---   

> Even faced with ... evidence ... [from] a ten-year study of around  250,000 men that showed the test didn’t save lives, many activists and medical professionals are clamoring for men to continue receiving their annual PSA test.  

New evidence emerges as time proceeds, and there are advances in the 
approach to treatment.  At least part of the problem has been a rush 
to treatments that themselves risk increasing damage and the risk of 
death.  Note the comment in @brawley2018prostate that

> Over the past few years, the benefit‐to‐harm ratio has 
improved in favor of benefit if the man understands that 
active surveillance may be a reasonable path if diagnosed.

## Kahneman overview

Part I: Two Systems (System 1 versus System 2)  
This aims to show how 
"... associative memory, the core of System 1, attempts to give a coherent
account of what is going on in our world in any instant"

Part 2: Heuristics and biases
* Why is it so difficult for us to think statistically?
* We easily think associatively, ... metaphorically, casually,
but statistics requires thinking about many things at once ...

Part 3: Choices
* We have "an excessive confidence in what we think we know"

Part 4: A conversation with the discipline of economics
* The Prospect theory model of choice
    + "... unfortunate tendency to treat problems in isolation"
    + Framing effects --- inconsequential features shape choices
    + A challenge to the assumptions of standard economics.
    
Part 5: Two selves --- Experiencing, remembering
* These do not always have the same interests.
* Automatic memory formation has its own rules
    + Exploit to improve the memory of a bad episode
* The virtues of educating gossip
    + Use to improve the quality of judgments and decisions
    + Judge decisions by how they are made, not by outcome.

## System 1 and System 2 --- further comments

* System 1 Features
    + It may substitute an easier question
    + It responds to priming, framing, affect, memory illusions,
    illusions of truth, ...
    + It has little understanding of logic and statistics
    + It cannot be turned off
    + When flummoxed, it calls on System 2
* The world of System 2
    + It keeps you polite when angry, alert when driving at night
    + In its world, gorillas do not cross basket-ball courts ...
    + There are some vital tasks that only System 2 can perform
    + Problems that put 1 & 2 in conflict may require large
    mental effort & self-control to overcome the impulses and
    intuitions of System 1
* Healthy living is a compromise
     + Recognize situations where mistakes are likely
     + Aim to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high
     
Kahneman describes System 1 and System 2 as "fictions"! I prefer
to describe them as providing a model that is helpful in 
accounting for the way that humans make judgments.

* Human mental quirks make it useful to think of these as agents.
* Stories about active agents who have personalities, habits, and 
abilities readily take root in our minds
* Ascribing calculation to System 2 is shorthand for ...
    + "This requires mental effort. Do not do when driving!"
    + Pupils will be dilated, and heart rate elevated.  

## Try not to be fooled
    
* We make judgments based on evidence that is too limited
* We are easily fooled by irrelevancies
    + Kahneman has brought together evidence on what & how.
* Getting & assessing good evidence takes discipline & work 
    + Data may (rarely) be there for the taking;
    but someone has to notice, and collate the data.
    + Randomized experiments are often the ideal, but require
    meticulous planning. If differences are small, the numbers
    required may be very large.  See further, Subsection \@ref(ss:rct).
* Keep in mind Yule-Simpson "paradox", which we will encounter
later in Subsection \@ref(sec:yule1)
    + The paradox lies in the failure of human intuition to
    accommodate straightforward arithmetic!

    (This animated video provides a short overview)
    
An irony is that Kahneman was, as he has acknowledged, 
himself fooled into taking at face values papers that 
claimed to show that verbal concepts could have the 
effect of altering behaviour.  Thus

* Being asked to write down stories about unethical deeds
made people more likely to want to buy soap;
* Subtly drawing attention to money, e.g., leave banknotes
lying around, made people feel more self-sufficient, and 
care less about others;
* Priming people with old age related words leads people to
walk more slowly away from the lab as research
assistants armed with stopwatches timed their movements.

As @ritchie2020science notes (p.28) Kahneman was not alone 
in being fooled --- the study about priming with old age 
related words has been extensively cited in
psychology textbooks. None of these claims have stood up
in attempts at replication, with larger numbers and with
greater care to avoid unconscious sources of bias. Thus,
in the replication of the study relating to age-related
words, infra-red beams were used to measure time taken
to walk between two points in a hallway, rather than
research assistants who knew the group to which
participants had been assigned.

### Think again --- a very simple example {-}

Is symptom X associated with disease A?

|| Has Disease | No Disease
| ----------------- | -- | --- | ---
| Symptom X Present | 20 | 10
| Symptom X Absent | 80 | 40

The symptom occurs with the same relative frequency, whether or
not a person has the disease.
Nisbett comments that most people, including nurses and doctors,
interpret such evidence wrongly [@nisbett, pp.129-130].
    
## By classical economic criteria, humans misbehave!

The discipline of "behavioural economics" largely took shape
as a result of the work of Richard Thaler.  Kahneman was
one of two mentors who strongly influenced Thaler --- the
other was Amos Tversky, who had worked closely with Kahneman.

@thaler2015misbehaving explores the extent to which humans do
not behave like the rational agents of classical economics, 
agents to whom Thaler gives the name "econs". Added to the
irrationality with which we often act is that our personal
priorities are unlikely to align precisely with those of econs.

## Helpful Questions for Life in an Uncertain World^[These came originally from the Harding Center web site <https://www.hardingcenter.de/en>.]

1. Risk of what? (Showing a symptom, ..., Death)
2. What is the time frame? (next 10 years, or lifetime)
3. How big is the risk? (Look at risk in absolute terms)
4. Does the risk apply to me? (Age, sex, health, ...)
5. What are the harms of "finding out"? (False alarms, invasive
diagnostic procedures, unnecessary or dangerous treatments.)
