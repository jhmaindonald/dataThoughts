<h1>Preface<a href="#preface" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble.
Its what you know for sure that just ain’t so.
[Variously attributed; author unknown]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This booklet has as its intended audience, as well as practising
researchers, anyone interested in using data as a basis for
judgment. The critical processes and skills that are discussed
have wide application, in everyday as well as in professional life.</p>
<p>The questions that data and data analysis may be asked to answer can
often be stated simply. This may encourage the layperson to believe
that the steps needed to provide answers are similarly simple.
Very often, they are not. It is alluringly easy to create forms of
data summary that misrepresent what the data have to say.<br />
Or inadequate attention may be paid to the context from which the
data have been taken. The context has to be understood and to feed
into the way that the data are used, if conclusions are to be drawn
that warrant credence.</p>
<p>The pages that follow avoid detailed discussion of methodology,
instead focusing on what Kahneman, in his book
“Thinking Fast and Slow”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> calls “educating gossip”,
with examples taken from the media and from the research literature.
Examples are chosen for the insight that they may provide, both
those that show effective critical processes at work, and those
that do not.</p>
<p>When they function well, scientific processes work to avoid the
traps that will be discussed. They fail often enough that examples
of failure are relatively easy to find. Cases where scientific
processes have clearly failed are commonest where scientists work
as individuals or in small groups with limited outside checks.</p>
<p>In areas where the nature of the work requires cooperation between
scientists with a wide range of skills, and where data and code
are shared, those involved in the research provide a check on each
other. Papers may be sent for comment to other researchers, or
posted on the net for comment, prior to formal submission for
publication. This allows informed and incisive criticism, with
the more formal refereeing process providing supplementary checks.</p>
<p>Concerns about reproducibility, especially in wet laboratory
biology and in psychology, have in the past decade attracted
wide attention in the pages of Nature, Science, the Economist,
psychology journals, and elsewhere. Among other needed changes,
publication of experimental results needs to become a staged
process that moves from “this is worth a look” to “has been
independently replicated” to “established result”.</p>
<p>Human psychology helps explain why humans so readily fall for
conclusions that are both simplistic and wrong. Humans are
programmed, by inheritance and by conditioning, to respond
quickly to signs of immediate danger. Too often, we respond
quickly and without careful thought in situations that call
for a carefully reasoned response. Or, we may not have the
skills needed for a carefully reasoned judgment.
It is helpful to think about the psychology involved when humans
make judgments as of two types, which Kahneman (2013) calls System 1
(jumping quickly to a conclusion) and System 2 (pondering).
These are a useful starting point for drawing attention to common
traps to which humans are prone. Those who know and understand
common traps are better placed to avoid them.</p>

<li>Understand the psychology — why the showcase of fallacies
<ul>
<li>Recognize and avoid the mental traps to which humans are prone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Graphs can reveal surprises. They can also be drawn
so that they deceive.
<ul>
<li>Choice of one or both scales such that equal relative

</ul></li>
<li>From hindsight to insight — it is easy to be deceived.
<ul>
<li>If a sportsperson is at the top of their form, the only
way to go is down. If at the bottom, the only way is up.</li>
<li>This is true also for success in business.</li>
<li>Chance, as well as form, obviously plays a part.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Medicine and health provides a good context into which to study
a number of important issues. What causes cholera – bad air or bad water?
Does drinking coffee help or harm health?
<ul>
<li>Randomized trials, if done rigorously, and participants
closely reflect the population to which results will be applied,
are a gold standard.</li>
<li>Think carefully about the outcome measure. Thus, is it
“cancers” found? Or is it “deaths” within a stated timeframe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Careful checks are needed when the attempt is made to use
observational data to establish causation.
<ul>
<li>In group comparisons, adjustments are needed
to account for prior differences between the two (or more)
groups. What checks can be made that adjustments are adequate?
It is in general impossible to be sure that adjustments account
for all effects other than the effectm that is of interest.</li>
<li>In what direction, and through what causal chains, do causal
effects go? Are people healthier because they exercise more?
Or, do they exercise more because they are healthier? Or, do
causal effects go in both directions? What are the influences
from dietary and other lifestyle factors?</li>
<li>An overwhelming case can sometimes be made, as in the link
between smoking and lung cancer, by bringing together multiple
independent lines of evidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mistakes that arise from statistical misunderstandings
can have serious consequences.
<ul>
<li>This is the case also for fraudulent manipulation of
data and/or evidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Weighting paradoxes appears in many different guises.
A notable example is the Yule-Simpson paradox, which arises
because we have naively added numbers in ways that give more
weight to some combinations of effects than to others.</li>
<li>What direction does the correlation go?
<ul>
<li>Tall fathers are likely to have tall sons, but shorter than themselves.</li>
<li>What can be hard to grasp is that the effect goes on both directions.
Tall sons are likely to have tall fathers, but shorter than themselves.
The “regression to the mean” phenomenon goes in both directions.<br />
</li>
<li>Regression models require careful checking to ensure that they
correctly reflect all systematic effects in the data.</li>
<li>The coefficient that is attached to an explanatory variable accounts
for the effect of that variable when other variables are help constant.
The coefficient is likely to change with the change to different
explanatory variables that give the same predicted values.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Results become part of established science when they have
survived informed critique. Work that claims to revise or overturn
established results has itself to survive the same informed critique.
<ul>
<li>Uninformed critique is common. Watch for the tricks that
detractors who find established scientific results inconvenient
use in the attempt to discredit them.</li>
<li>When presented with scientific (or any) claims, ask/check
whether claims have been carefully critiqued. For laboratory
studies, have results been replicated?</li>
<li>Publication processes work best where authors contribute
input and critique widely from across different disciplinary
perspectives, and where data and code are made available for
checking.</li>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Systems of human judgment<a href="#systems-of-human-judgment" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>An understanding of the mental traps to which we are prone can help us avoid them. Kahneman’s book <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kahneman_2013">2013</a>)</span> <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> is a good starting point for thinking about the strengths and limitations of human thinking processes. There is no good substitute for the use of “educating gossip”, as Kahneman describes it, for training in effective judgment and in decision making.</p>
<p>Important themes that Kahneman notes are</p>
<ul>
<li>We have “an excessive confidence in what we think we know”.</li>
<li>We too readily judge decisions by outcome, rather than by the
strength of the arguments that support them.</li>
<li>We have two selves — an experiencing self and a remembering self
<ul>
<li>These do not always have the same interests.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Automatic memory formation has its own rules
<ul>
<li>This is exploited to improve the memory of a bad episode</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“We easily think associatively, … metaphorically, casually, but statistics requires thinking about many things at once …”</li>
</ul>
<div id="system-1-and-system-2-further-comments" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> System 1 and System 2 — further comments<a href="#system-1-and-system-2-further-comments" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Humans have been conditioned to respond quickly to immediate risks and challenges, without stopping to consider too carefully whether what we heard was a false alarm. They also have the ability, when the occasion seems to demand it, to stop to ponder. This is the basis for Kahneman’s categorization of human thought  processes as of two types — System 1 which jumps rapidly to make a judgment, and System 2 which takes time for careful consideration.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>System 1 Features are</p>
<ul>
<li>It may answer an easier question in place of a harder.</li>
<li>It responds to irrelevancies — priming, framing, affect, memory illusions, illusions of truth, …
<ul>
<li>Priming by one stimulus can affect the response to a second
stimulus that occurs shortly aferwards</li>
<li>The portrayal of logically equivalent alternatives in different
ways or ‘frames’ can affect the response</li>
<li>The emotion or ‘affect’ generated by a question can affect the
response</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It has little understanding of logic and statistics</li>
<li>It cannot be turned off, but it can be trained</li>
<li>When flummoxed, it calls on System 2</li>
</ul>
<p>System 2 features are</p>
<ul>
<li>It keeps you polite when angry, alert when driving in a severe
rainstorm</li>
<li>In its world, gorillas do not cross basket-ball courts …<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>Problems that put 1 &amp; 2 in conflict may require large mental effort &amp; self-control to overcome the impulses and intuitions of System 1.</li>
<li>Its effectiveness depends, in important areas, on training.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both systems are amenable to training. A well-trained System 2 helps
greatly in creating a better System 1. Further points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy living is a compromise
<ul>
<li>Recognize situations where mistakes are likely</li>
<li>Aim to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Untrained humans are poor intuitive statisticians</li>
<li>Judgments about statistical issues may require us to think about more than one, even many, things at once.</li>
<li>Too often, we jump to conclusions, without careful assessment.</li>
<li>We may not be equipped to make an informed and carefully thought through decision.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The Intuition of Professionals<a href="#the-intuition-of-professionals" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Effective professional training is designed to ensure that at least some of the results of well-tuned System 2 expert judgment operate at a System 1 level.
The professional will, if the training is doing its job, build up a
repetoire of System 2 judgments that will later, when the circumstances
seem to demand it, be available at a System 1 level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.<br />

<h3>Obstacles to effective judgment<a href="#obstacles-to-effective-judgment" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Even those who are experts in their field can be similarly prone to judgments that have no foundation in fact. The following comment appeared in a discussion of
the response to a U.S. Preventive Services assessment that prostate screening,
when used in accordance with then current treatment practices, was doing more
harm than good.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even faced with … evidence … from a ten-year study of around 250,000
men that showed the test didn’t save lives, many activists and medical professionals are clamoring for men to continue receiving their annual PSA test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New evidence emerges as time proceeds, and there are advances in the approach to treatment. At least part of the problem has been a rush to treatments that themselves risk increasing damage and the risk of death. Note the comment in <span class="citation">Brawley (<a href="#ref-brawley2018prostate">2018</a>)</span> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few years, the benefit‐to‐harm ratio has improved in favor of benefit if the man understands that active surveillance may be a reasonable path if diagnosed.</p>

<li>We make judgments based on evidence that is too limited</li>
<li>We are easily fooled by irrelevancies
<ul>
<li>Kahneman has brought together evidence on what &amp; how.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even when data are there for the taking, someone has to notice, to collate the data, and to understand its uses and limitations</li>
<li>Randomized controlled experiments (RCTs) are often the ideal, but require meticulous planning. If effects of interest are small, the numbers required may be very large. See further, Subsection <a href="#ss:rct">4.2</a>
<ul>
<li>A limitation is that results apply only to the population from which
trial participants were taken. Any wider generalization has to be justified</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Observational data does not easily, if at all, substitute for the use of
RCTs. It is in general impossible to be sure that all sources of bias have
been properly accounted for</li>
<li>Keep in mind Yule-Simpson “paradox”, which we will encounter later in Subsection <a href="#sec:yule1">6</a>

<h3>The “conjunction fallacy”<a href="#the-conjunction-fallacy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This has also, as a result of the example given in
<span class="citation">Tversky and Kahneman (<a href="#ref-tversky1983extensional">1983</a>)</span> come to be known as “the Linda problem”.
The name ‘Linda’ comes from the question and usual response
that are given by way of example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linda is a 31-year old philosophy graduate, single, outspoken, and bright. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Which of the following is more probable?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Linda is a bank teller.</li>
<li>Linda is a bank teller, and active in the feminist movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding the further descriptor “active in the feminist movement” can only lower the probability, or just possibly leave it unchanged. Instead of assessing the balance of probabilities, we are tempted to ask which description best meshes with what we have been already told about Linda.</p>
<p>“Linda is active in the feminist movement” is the single descriptor” that respondents see as best fitting Linda. While that was not what was asked, one has to pay close attention to prevent System 1 from substituting that for the question that was asked. Note that the correct answer will be “a bank teller”, irrespective of the way that Linda was characterized before the question was asked.</p>
<p>In part, the issue is one of use of language. The “correct” answer is asking us to use the word “probable” in a strict technical sense.</p>

<h3>Even careful critics sometimes get it wrong<a href="#even-careful-critics-sometimes-get-it-wrong" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>An irony is that Kahneman was, as he has acknowledged, himself fooled into taking at face values papers that claimed to show that verbal concepts could have the effect of altering behaviour. Thus</p>
<ul>
<li>Being asked to write down stories about unethical deeds made people more likely to want to buy soap;</li>
<li>Subtly drawing attention to money, e.g., leave banknotes lying around, made people feel more self-sufficient, and care less about others;</li>
<li>Priming people with old age related words leads people to walk more slowly away from the lab as research assistants armed with stopwatches timed their movements.</li>
</ul>
<p>As <span class="citation">Ritchie (<a href="#ref-ritchie2020science">2020</a>)</span> notes (p.28) Kahneman was not alone in being fooled — the study about priming with old age related words has been extensively cited in psychology textbooks. None of these claims have stood up in attempts at replication, with larger numbers and with greater care to avoid unconscious sources of bias. Thus, in the replication of the study relating to age-related words, infra-red beams were used to measure time taken to walk between two points in a hallway, rather than research assistants who knew the group to which participants had been assigned.</p>

<p>The discipline of “behavioural economics” largely took shape as a result of the work of Richard Thaler. Kahneman was one of two mentors who strongly influenced Thaler — the other was Amos Tversky, who had worked closely with Kahneman.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Thaler and Ganser (<a href="#ref-thaler2015misbehaving">2015</a>)</span> explores the extent to which humans do not behave like the rational agents of classical economics, agents to whom Thaler gives the name “econs”.

<p>Note also comments in Part 4 of <span class="citation">Kahneman (<a href="#ref-kahneman_2013">2013</a>)</span>, titled “A conversation with the discipline of economics”. In a discussion on “The Prospect theory model of choice”, Kahneman comments on</p>
<ul>
<li>“… unfortunate tendency to treat problems in isolation”</li>
<li>Framing effects — inconsequential features shape choices</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice, in Panel A, the use of scales for which which equal distances on the scale correspond to equal relative changes. This is achieved by specifying logarithmic scales, on both axes. There is a loglinear, i.e., straight line on logarithmic scales, relationship.</p>
<p>In Figure <a href="#fig:resid">2.4</a>, the line looks to be a good fit. The range of times is however large, from just under 10 seconds to close to 11.5 hours. All except the largest difference from the fitted line are a less than 7% change, and are not at all obvious in Panel A. There is a very clear pattern of systematic differences in Panel B that reflects differences in human physiology, very likely between the athletes who excel at the different distances.</p>
<p>The line can be interpreting as implying a 13% increase in the time per unit distance for every unit increase in the distance. The units may for example be units of 100 meters, or kilometers. Panel B indicates that the pattern of increase moves down to a local minimum at around 200 meters, up to a local maximum at around 1 kilometer, down again to a local minimum at around 20 kilometers, and then steadily up again.</p>

<p>Quota sampling has often been used as an alternative to random
sampling — quotas are set for age categories, male/female,
and socioeconomic categories that are designed to ensure that
the sample is representative of the wider population.
In polls prior to the 1948 US presidential election that
pitted democrat Harry Truman against republican Thomas Dewey,
pollsters were given strict quotas, but otherwise left free to
decide who they would approach. Polls by three different
organizations gave Dewey a lead of between 5% and 15%. In the
event, Truman led by 5%.</p>

Convenience samples, taken within a limited population,

It is strongly in the public interest that scientists have
reasonable freedom for responsible expression of their minds
on issues of public concern. In an informal 2015 survey, 151
Crown Research Institute scientists (out of 384 who responded)
answered yes to the question “Have you ever been prevented
from making a public comment on a controversial issue by your
management’s policy, or by fear of losing research funding?”
The 384 who responded will undoubtedly be a biased sample.
Irrespective of the size of the bias, the number who had not
been allowed to speak their mind was large enough to be a cause
for serious concern. Hon Joyce’s response, to the effect that
as this was not a scientific survey of all CRI scientists
(to this extent, true), its evidence of large concern could be
ignored, was an evasion. Equally disturbing was the reaction
of the NIWA management, suggesting that they did not accept a
responsibility to defend transparency.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:cotton">3.1</a> compares the US Bureau of Labor

The 1889 survey shows some strong biases — a result it
would seem of geographical bias and of the informal data
collection methods that were used. The high wages given to
spinners were grossly over-weighted in the US Bureau of
Labor survey, while Big Piecers and Weavers were grossly
under-represented. A guess is that workers were asked for
information on their wages as they left work, and that
the survey personnel happened to catch employees at a time
when there was a large preponderance of highly paid spinners,
and an untypically small number of big piecers and weavers.
The net effect was a gross over-estimate of average wages.</p>

<p>There is a mix of selection and survivor bias when data
from the past are used as a guide to the future, with no
allowance for the source/target difference. The target about
which we wish to make judgments lies in the future, while the
data are from the past. Think about a business that is
planning for the future. One can never know, until after the
event, all the ramifications of the choices made.</p>
<p>Businesses may be selected as examples of effective business
practice because they were, at the time when the data were
collated, successful. Likewise, it is athletes who have
been successful in the recent past who are likely to be
selected to appear on the covers of sports magazines.
In either case, this gives a biased picture of what can be
expected in the future — in many cases those who are
picked out will be close to the peak of their success,
and/or have had unusual luck. High levels of success in
the recent past will not always translate into success
in the following year or years. How often will past
success translate into future success? In order to
discover, it is necessary to collect relevant data.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> The message in the missing bullet holes<a href="#ss:wald" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In World War II, the US air force was concerned that too many
of their planes were being shot down. What were the priority
areas to which protective armour should be added, given that
the extra weight meant that they could not be placed everywhere?
Abraham Wald’s insight was that survivor bias was to be
expected, with the density of bullet holes providing evidence
about the extent of bias, and the implications for identifying
the part(s) of the planes that would benefit most from
additional protection. See <a href="https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d">Abraham Wald and the Missing Bullet Holes</a><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>,
which is an excerpt from <span class="citation">Ellenberg (<a href="#ref-ellenberg_2015">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The numbers of hits per square foot were:</p>
<pre><code>      Engines      Fusilage   Fuel system Rest of plane 
         1.11          1.73          1.55          1.80 </code></pre>
<p>Wald argued that the gunshots were likely to have been spread
very nearly uniformly over the planes as a whole, those that
were shot down, and those that survived, The reason for relatively
fewer bullet holes in the engine and fuel system areas was that
hits in those areas were more likely to bring the plane down,
so that they did not return.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Randomized Controlled Trials vs other study types<a href="#ss:rct" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Two types of study are widely used in medical and other contexts — randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and population-based studies. These can, in both cases, be broken down into further sub-types. There may be elements of both these types of studies.</p>
<div id="randomized-controlled-trials-the-gold-standard" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Randomized Controlled Trials — the gold standard?<a href="#randomized-controlled-trials-the-gold-standard" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>For simplicity, it will be assumed that there are two alternatives to be compared, in what is known as a two-armed trial. In medical trials the two arms may be a treatment and a placebo, with the placebo (something harmless that has no effect) made to look as similar as possible to the treatment.</p>
<p>An important distinction is between pre-clinical trials, often with animals such as mice, and clinical trials with human subjects. Pre-clinical trials are likely to be conducted with a small number of mice or other animals, and are intended to check whether a drug or other treatment warrants further investigation. Evidence will be presented in Section <a href="#sec:lab">9.4</a> that suggests that these trials are commonly not achieving their intended purpose.</p>
<p>Clinical trials typically are conducted in three phases. Phase I applies the treatment to a small number of subjects and checks that the treatment appears safe. Phase II, perhaps with several hundred subjects, looks for evidence of an effect, and how this might relate to dose level. Phase III trials are conducted with large numbers of subjects, typically spread over multiple treatment centres, and are designed to check whether the treatment is effective, what side effects there may be, and whether there are issues with particular subgroups.</p>
<p>Important issues are</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a random mechanism to assign to assign to treatment as against control — in a medical screening study to “screen” or “not screen”
<ul>
<li>The aim is to ensure that apples are compared with apples</li>
<li>Treatment and control must otherwise be treated in the same way.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There must be strict adherence to a protocol
<ul>
<li>Minor departures that may, e.g., allow unconscious bias in the way that results from the different groups of participants are measured, can invalidate results.</li>
<li>In clinical trials an ideal, not always possible, is the double blind trial where neither the individual nor the clinician involved knows which drug (or other treatment) the individual has received.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Results apply, strictly, to those who meet the trial entry criteria
<ul>
<li>This may limit relevance to the general population</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Especially in medical trials, think carefully about the outcome measure. It is not enough to show that a screening program will pick up otherwise undiagnosed cancers.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a screening trial, e.g., for prostate cancer, there are risks both for those who test positive, and for those who test negative.
<ul>
<li>The process used to check for cancer may itself bring a smaller or larger element of risk.</li>
<li>Positives may be false positives, leading to more invasive checks which may themselves carry a risk. Thus, for prostate cancer, a positive PSA test is likely to lead to a biopsy that itself has been estimated to carry a 5% risk of serious side effects, with a much higher proportion of less serious effects <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-levitin_2015">Levitin 2015, 245</a>)</span></li>
<li>Some slow growing cancers may be better left untreated, rather than exposing the patient to a treatment that may itself do serious damage.</li>

</ul>
<p>Where a treatment is compared with a control group, the idea is to use a regression type approach to adjust for differences in such variables or factors as age, sex, socioeconomic status, and co-morbidities. “Propensity score” approaches try to summarize such group differences in a single variable (or, in principle, two or more variables) that measure the propensity to belong to the treatment as opposed to the control group. While their effectiveness for this purpose may be doubted, they can be used to provide insightful graphs that check the extent to which the groups are broadly comparable on the variables and/or factors used to adjust for differences.</p>

<li>the 1990 without the syndrome will split up as detected +ve to detected -ve in an 20%:80% ratio. Thus there will be, on average, .2 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 1990 = <strong>398</strong> false positives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, those detected as positive split up in a true:false ratio of 8:398, i.e., 8/406 or just under 2% of the positives are false positives. If all positives were detected as positive, the 8/406 would change to 10/406.</p>
<p>A test with this kind of accuracy becomes much more useful in a subset of the population already known to be at high risk, perhaps as identified by a genetic test, or perhaps because of a medical condition commonly associated with the syndrome.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Hierarchies of evidence<a href="#hierarchies-of-evidence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>There is broad agreement among medical researchers on the hierarchy of evidence that is set down in the <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-us1989guide">US Preventive Services Task Force 1989</a>)</span> guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial.</li>
<li>Level II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization.</li>
<li>Level II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort studies or case-control studies, preferably from more than one centre or research group.</li>
<li>Level II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple time series designs with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.</li>
<li>Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CONSORT 2010 statement <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Schulzc332">Schulz, Altman, and Moher 2010</a>)</span> sets out detailed criteria for assessing randomized controlled trials (RCTs). For Level II studies, the STROBE guidelines <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-erik2007strengthening">Erik von Elm et al. 2007</a>)</span> set out reporting standards.</p>
<p>Use of such criteria is essential when evidence that is available from multiple randomized controlled trials, perhaps supplemented by evidence from studies at lower levels of the hierarchy, is brought together in a systematic review. Evidence at level II, and especially at level II-3, should ideally be checked by conducting an RCT. This is not always possible, for ethical or practical reasons.</p>
<p>Evidence from one type of study may complement evidence from another. A paper entitled “Resolved: there is sufficient scientific evidence that decreasing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption will reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hu2013resolved">Hu 2013</a>)</span> provides an example. Hu brings evidence from short-term randomized controlled trials together with evidence from long term cohort studies (4 or 8 years) to make a convincing case.</p>
<p>Clinical trials have their own problems and issues. Using evidence from published review sources, <span class="citation">Chalmers and Glasziou (<a href="#ref-chalmers2009avoidable">2009</a>)</span> found issues with the choice of research questions; the quality of research design and methods, and the adequacy of publication practices. They reported that 50% of studies were designed without reference to systematic reviews of existing evidence, and that 50% were never published in full.</p>
<p>Planning and execution failures are set in stone by the time that a research report is sent for review. Pre-registration, involving the depositing a research question and study design with a registration service or journal before starting an investigation, allows peer review feedback that can elicit suggestions for improvement and detect any potential flaws before the study begins.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Even more than for industrial quality control, processes are needed that prevent defects from appearing in the first place, with screening for defects at the end of the production line used as a check that those processes have done the job asked of them.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Avoid, or expose infants to peanuts?<a href="#avoid-or-expose-infants-to-peanuts" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Clinical practice guidelines introduced in or around the year 2000 had “recommended the exclusion of allergenic foods from the diets of infants at high risk for allergy, and from the diets of their mothers during pregnancy and lactation.”</p>
<p>It was then a surprise to find that the prevalence of peanut allergy has substantially increased in the recent past, doubling in Europe between 2005 and 2015, suggesting that advice given to parents of young children to avoid foods containing peanuts may have been counterproductive. This reassessment was supported, at least for infants who at four months had either severe eczema or food allergy or both, and thus were at high risk of developing a peanut allergy, by the LEAPS study reported in <span class="citation">Du Toit et al. (<a href="#ref-du2015randomized">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As noted, the LEAPS study was limited to infants who at four months had either severe eczema or food allergy or both. Infants were stratified into two groups following a skin-prick test, with each group then randomized between those exposed to peanut extract, and those not exposed.</p>
<p>Among 530 infants in the population who initially had negative results on the skin-prick test, the prevalence of peanut allergy at 60 months of age was 13.7% (37/270) in the avoidance group and 1.8% (5/272) in the consumption group.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Among the 98 participants who initially had positive test results, the prevalence of peanut allergy was 35.3% (18/51) in the avoidance group and 10.6% (5/47) in the consumption group. There was no between-group difference of consequence in the incidence of serious adverse events.</p>
<p>In both groups, numbers and percentages are for those who were assigned to the group and whose results could be evaluated, whether or not they followed the treatment protocol to which they were assigned. In technical terms, these are results from an “intention to treat” analysis. Such an analysis is designed to mirror what can be expected in practice — not everyone who starts off in one group will stick to it. It answers questions about what to do with subjects who did not fully follow the treatment to which they were assigned.</p>
<p>The results were followed, in 2016, by changes to guidelines that recommended introduction of peanut and other allergenic foods before 12 months. The assumption that avoiding early exposure to peanuts would reduce risk of later development of peanut allergy was, it was judged, likely wrong for all infants.</p>

<p>Humans are very prone to the <em>post hoc, ergo propter hoc</em> fallacy: “it followed, therefore it was because of” fallacy. Harris argues that unless the benefits of a surgical procedure are clear, the only ethical way forward is to do a randomized trial where the procedure is compared with a sham procedure. Such trials are not easy to design and execute. Nonetheless, there are a number of important cases where such comparisons have been made.</p>

<p>Screening for cancer is an area where, if the interest is in risk of death, it is necessary to wait for perhaps several decades before there is a high enough number of deaths that results can be usefully evaluated. Changes that can be expected in the interim include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screening may become more sensitive, perhaps picking up a higher proportion of relatively benign cancers that are unlikely to ever have serious effects.<br />
</li>
<li>There may be an increased ability to distinguish between benign and more aggressive cancers.<br />
</li>
<li>More effective and/or less invasive treatments may become available, and earlier treatments finessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>All cause death rates are a more relevant measure than cancer specific death rates, as treatments may themselves have harmful effects. Whether or not results from clinical trials in past decades remain relevant to current circumstances, their results do highlight important questions.</p>

<p>About 10 out of every 1,000 men with screening, and 12 out of every 1,000 men without screening, died from prostate cancer within 16 years. This means that 2 out of every 1,000 people could be saved from death from prostate cancer by early detection using PSA testing. Deaths from any cause were around 322 in both groups.</p>
<p>Numbers for benefits are based on four studies with about 77,000 participants (progressive cancer), four studies with about 472,000 participants (overall mortality), and eleven studies with about 619,000 participants (prostate cancer specific mortality). The numbers for harms are based on seven studies with approximately 128,000 participants (false-positive results within three to six participations in PSA testing for early detection) and nine studies with approximately 274,000 participants (over-diagnosis and over-treatment). See the web site for references to the studies.</p>
<p>Unlike the biopsies that may follow a positive PSA test, the PSA test has no direct potential to cause physical harm. Harm results from an undue readiness to use the test result as a reason for further potentially harmful testing and treatment. “Wait and watch” is often the preferred strategy.</p>

<p>The <span class="citation">Raichand et al. (<a href="#ref-raichand2017conclusions">2017</a>)</span> review starts with the comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent controversy about using mammography to screen for breast cancer based on randomized controlled trials over 3 decades in Western countries has not only eclipsed the paradigm of evidence-based medicine, but also puts health decision-makers in countries where breast cancer screening is still being considered in a dilemma to adopt or abandon such a well-established screening modality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The short summary, last updated in October 2019, from the <a href="https://www.hardingcenter.de/en/early-detection-breast-cancer-mammography-screening">Harding Center Fact Box for Mammography Screening</a>, referring to women 50 years (a few trials looked at women aged $$40) and older who either did or did not participate in mammography screening for approximately 11 years reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mammography reduced the number of women who died from breast cancer by 1 out of every 1000 women. It had no effect on the number of women who died from any type of cancer. Among all women taking part in screening, some women with non-progressive cancer were over-diagnosed and received unnecessary treatment.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chief English source of evidence for the fact box is the Cochrane review <span class="citation">Gøtzsche and Jørgensen (<a href="#ref-gotzsche2013screening">2013</a>)</span>. The eight eligible trials included more than 600,000 women aged between 39 and 74, all reported between 1963 and 1991. One trial was excluded because the randomization had not produced comparable groups. Four trials had inadequate randomization. The three trials with adequate randomization did not find an effect of screening on total cancer mortality.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Løberg et al. (<a href="#ref-loberg2015benefits">2015</a>)</span> provide a slightly more detailed breakdown of the evidence, as applied to women who were screened for 20 years, starting at age 50, with mortality assessed at ages 56 to 75 in the UK. Figure <a href="#fig:c-screen">4.1</a> is a visual summary. Interval cancers are cancers that are detected in between regular screens.

<p>The area by area phasing of the introduction of a mammography screening program in Ireland over 1994-2011 had the character of a natural experiment, allowing checks on what the before/after difference of each area as it was phased in, as against areas where the rollout occurred earlier or later. <span class="citation">Moran and Cullinan (<a href="#ref-MORAN2022115073">2022</a>)</span> looked at data on the ten-year follow-up of 33,722 breast cancer cases. The conclusion was that “while invitation to screening increased detection, it did not significantly decrease the average risk of dying from breast cancer in the population.” The authors did however note that “screening may have helped to reduce socioeconomic disparities in late stage breast cancer incidence.”</p>
<p>The historical data does, irrespective of questions regarding its current direct relevance, emphasize the importance of tuning breast cancer checks to the risk profile, of finding ways to distinguish progressive from non-progressive cancer, and of avoiding over-treatment. Early diagnosis may allow the use of less invasive forms of treatment. As argued in <span class="citation">Esserman and WISDOM Study and Athena Investigators (<a href="#ref-essermanwisdom">2017</a>)</span>, women want “better, not more screening”.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 5</span> The uses and limits of observational data<a href="#ch:obs" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>At least in principle, it is relatively straightforward to use regression type methods to make predictions for a set of new data that have been sampled in the same way. What is hard for observational data, harder than is commonly acknowledged, is to give the model coefficients a causal interpretation. For this, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the processes involved.</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be several, perhaps a very large number, of explanatory variables, and an outcome variable.</li>
<li>The aim is to find a model that will make predictions for new data.</li>
<li>Note the predictive/descriptive distinction.<br />
</li>
<li>Note the “in sample/out of sample” distinction.
<ul>
<li>But is the “new” a random sample of the old population?<br />
(Is the ‘target’ a random sample of the ‘source’?)</li>

<p>The issues that arise for observational studies do not in general have clear and easy answers. Chapters 20 and 21 of <span class="citation">Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (<a href="#ref-gelman2020regression">2020</a>)</span> canvass points that authors of those studies need to address. See also <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/11/10/matching-discarding-non-matches-deal-lack-complete-overlap-regression-adjust-imbalance-treatment-control-groups/">Andrew Gelman’s blog.</a><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> There are no simple answers!<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>. All relevant explanatory variables have to be identified, with the manner in which they may be driving predictions then teased out.</p>
<p>Thus, in a comparison between two groups (e..g., in Section <a href="#sec:maternity">5.4</a>, midwife led versus medical led neonatal care) one variable or factor may be of particular interest, while other variables are used to adjust for differences between the two groups that are at most a secondary focus of interest. Variables that are of secondary interest are commonly referred to as covariates. Regression coefficients can be misleading guides to what is driving predictions if one or more of the relevant covariates is not available or is not properly accounted for. A paradox of the Yule-Simpson type, sometimes referred to as Laird’s paradox, has the same potential to mislead.</p>
<p>Little that has been published since <span class="citation">Rosenbaum (<a href="#ref-RosBook">2002</a>)</span> clarifies greatly the advice that can be given for practical data analysis, beyond what Rosenbaum has to say. <span class="citation">Pearl and Mackenzie (<a href="#ref-pearl2018book">2018</a>)</span> (“The Book of Why”) offers an interesting assessment. Pearl and his co-author do a good job of highlighting important issues that should be addressed in order to make causality judgments, at the same time overplaying what their methodology can in general achieve. If strictly implemented, the standards are so high that they severely limit what they can in practice achieve. Causality diagrams have a central role. There is a detailed, and insightful, discussion of the history that finally led to the conclusion that smoking causes lung cancer.</p>

<p>Farr took Snow’s arguments seriously, but in his 1852 report argued that water was primarily important as a vehicle for miasmata.

By the time of the 1854 epidemic, Lambeth had moved its intake 22 miles upriver, while the Southwark and Vauxhall intake was unchanged until 1855. Data on the distribution of cholera in the 1854 epidemic then allowed Snow to test the claims made in his 1849 study.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The experiment, too, was on the grandest scale. No fewer than 300,000 people …, from gentlefolks down to the very poor, were divided into two groups without their choice, and, in most cases, without their knowledge; one group being supplied with water containing the sewage of London, and, amongst it, whatever might have come from the cholera patients, the other group having water quite free from such impurity. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-snow1855mode">Snow 1855b</a>)</span></p>

<p>Snow noted that “Within 250 yards of the spot where Cambridge Street joins Broad Street there were upwards of 500 fatal attacks of cholera in 10 days…”. By contrast, none of the employees of a local Soho brewery developed cholera. The reason, he judged, was that they drank water from the brewery (which had a different source from the Broad St pump) or just drank beer alone.<br />

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Are there missing explanatory factors?<a href="#sec:maternity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wernham_EtAl_2016">Wernham et al. 2016</a>)</span> study used data from 244,047 singleton term deliveries that occurred between 2008 and 2012 to make the claim that midwife led care, as opposed to medical led care, gave a greater risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes. Notably, the claim was that midwife led care resulted in a lower Apgar score (a measure of infant health immediately after birth) and a greater risk of the imprecisely defined diagnosis of birth asphyxia.</p>
<p>This study was then the basis for exaggerated claims in an article in the October 8-14 2016 issue of the NZ Listener <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chisholm_2016">Chisholm 2016</a> “Birth Control”)</span>. Contrary to what was claimed, the research did not “lob a grenade into the historically war-torn territory of New Zealand’s maternity care.” Even less did its results warrant the melodramatic claims of “Alarming maternity research” and “Revolution gone wrong” that appeared on the Listener’s front cover.</p>
<p>A major issue with the analysis is that it relies on using the NZ Deprivation Index<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> to adjust for socioeconomic differences. This provides a deprivation score for meshblocks, each of around 60–110 people. It estimates the relative socioeconomic deprivation of an area, and does not directly relate to individuals. Deprived areas will often include some individuals with high socioeconomic status. Caesarean section, as a delivery type, may well have been more accessible for those of higher socioeconomic status. For National Women’s in Auckland, the elective Caesarean rate at term over 2006-2015 for doctor-led care was 32.8%, as against 7.4% for self employed midwives <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-farquhar2016letter">Farquhar, McCowan, and Fleming 2016</a>)</span>. Effects from fetal alcohol syndrome were not accounted for, nor were direct effects from substance abuse. International data indicates that fetal alcohol syndrome may affect as many as 3% of births.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Studies that are similarly relatively carefully done, but naive in the weight placed on the regression results, are embarrassingly common. There are analysis tools, and associated graphs, that the authors of the study could and should have used to shed light on the likely effectiveness of the adjustments made for differences between the two groups, other than whether the delivery was midwife led or medical led.</p>

<p>Two types of decision tree approaches will be discussed — the use of individual decision trees, and the random forest approach which generates and uses large numbers of trees in the decision making process.</p>

<h3>From trees to forests<a href="#from-trees-to-forests" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>“Random forests” improve on decision trees by using samples from the data to create a forest (a “random forest”) of trees, then voting between the trees. A downside is that “Random forests” and similar methods operate largely as black boxes. For detection of spam email, this may, as those who deploy the spam detectors have little idea what may be going on in the minds of the spammers, not be too much of an issue. One wants a spam detector that will respond effectively to whatever is thrown at it.</p>

<h3>It helps to know the how and why of the algorithms used<a href="#it-helps-to-know-the-how-and-why-of-the-algorithms-used" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Both decison trees and random forests follow an <em>algorithmic</em> process. The relatively “black box” nature of the random forest approach places an especially strong burden on the analyst to ensure relevant data have been used, and that the algorithm really is doing its intended task. In her book “Weapons of math destruction”, <span class="citation">O’Neil (<a href="#ref-oneil_2016">2016</a>)</span> comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… it’s not enough to just know how to run a black box algorithm. You actually need to know how and why it works, so that when it does’nt work, you can adjust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is too strong. But if one does not know the how and why of how an algorithm works, it is absolutely crucial to be sure that the data used to fit and test the model (the “training” and “test” data) are directly relevant to the task in hand.</p>
<p>Automated systems that can be easily gamed do, however, abound. They are a menace!</p>

</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:riskByAge">6.1</a> shows stark differences by age in US Covid-19 death rates. The US death rates per 1000 for under age 65 as opposed to age <span class="math inline">\(&gt;=\)</span> 65, were 0.28, 6.3 US totals for infection rates and for hospital admissions were also impacted by age structure, but to a lesser extent. More recent Covid-19 variants would present a somewhat different picture.</p>
<p>Countries with a lower proportion of their population aged &gt;=65 would, if the death rates for each of the two groups are similar to US rates, have lower overall death rates. The following compares the overall deaths rates for the US with what might, if these figures carried across, be expected for Kenya and for Italy.</p>
<pre><code>                               US Italy Kenya
Percentage 65 or more        16.3  23.3   2.5

<p>Once high enough vaccination rates have been achieved, a greater number of Covid-19 infections will be found among the vaccinated than among the vaccinated. Suppose that, for a particular age group and for a particular vaccine, the risk rate for severe Covid-19, is 5% for unvaccinated versus 1% for vaccinated, i.e. a relative risk of 5:1. Consider the following scenarios. The final column has the relative numbers, for unvaccinated versus vaccinated with Covid-19:</p>

<p>The 1-click strategy clearly gives a better return, both for US and for international users.</p>
<p>The overall figure is dominated by the result for the 150,000 international users (as opposed to 50,000 US) in the 1-click sample. This compares with the much weaker weighting towards international users (120,000 as opposed to 80,000) in the 2-click sample.</p>
<p>In the case that Smith reported, the type of analysis shown was followed up with a randomized experiment (an A/B test), where the probability of assignment to 1-click, as opposed to 2-click, was the same for both classes of user.</p>

<p>In population genetics, Simpson’s paradox type effects are known as epistasis. Most human societies are genetically heterogeneous. In San Francisco, any gene that is different between the European and Chinese populations will be found to be associated with the use of chopsticks! If a disease differs in frequency between the European and Chinese populations, then a naive analysis will find an association between that disease and any gene that differs in frequency between the European and Chinese populations.</p>
<p>Such effects are major issues for gene/disease population association studies. It is now common to collect genetic fingerprinting data that should identify major heterogeneity. Providing such differences are accounted for, large effects that show up in large studies are likely to be real. Small effects may well be epistatic.</p>

<p>The MMR vaccine was developed to for use in preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. Andrew Wakefield was the lead author of a study published in 1998, based on just twelve children, that claimed to find indications of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

<p>It emerged that</p>
<ul>
<li>Wakefield had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest</li>
<li>Funding came from a group of lawyers who were interested in possible personal injury lawsuits</li>
<li>From 9 children said to have regressive autism
<ul>
<li>Only 1 had been diagnosed; 3 had no autism</li>
<li>5 had developmental problems before the vaccine</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Wakefield’s 1998 claims were widely reported</p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland dropped sharply</li>
<li>The incidence of measles and mumps increased, resulting in deaths and in severe and permanent injuries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wakefield was found guilty by the General Medical Council of serious professional misconduct in May 2010 and was struck off the Medical Register.<br />
Following the initial claims in 1998, multiple large epidemiological studies failed to find any link between MMR and autism.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Sally Clark’s disturbing cot death story<a href="#sally-clarks-disturbing-cot-death-story" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Sudden Infant Death (SID), also referred to as “cot death”, is the name given to the unexplained sudden death of very young children. The story of Sally Clark’s unfortunate brush with the law, following the death of a second child, is interesting, disturbing, and educational. Sally’s experience highlighted ways in which the UK legal system needed to take on board issues that affect the use of medical evidence — issues of a type that can be important in medical research.</p>
<p>Paediatrician Sir Roy Meadow had argued in his 1997 book <strong>ABC of Child Abuse</strong> that “unless proved otherwise, one cot death is tragic, two is suspicious and three is murder.” Was this an example of “Too hard! Try something easier, and wrong!” Or was it the triumph of assumed “knowledge” over hard evidence?</p>
<p>Meadow’s role as an expert witness for the prosecution in several trials played a crucial part in wrongful convictions for murder. The case that attracted greatest attention is that of Sally Clarke, both of whose children were “cot death” victims. Following the death of the second child, Meadow gave evidence at her 1999 trial, and appeal in 2000. Sally Clark was finally acquitted in 2003.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meadow gave 1 in 8,500 as cot death rate in affluent non-smoking families
<ul>
<li>Squared 8,500 to get odds of 73,000,000:1 against for two deaths.</li>
<li>Meadow assumed, wrongly, that the probability of a death from natural causes was the same in all families.</li>
<li>A first “cot death” is, in some families at least, evidence of a greater proneness to death from natural causes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Royal Statistical Society press release: “Figure has no statistical basis”
<ul>
<li>2000 appeal judges: The figure was a “sideshow” that would not have influenced the jury’s decision.</li>
<li>The appeal judges’ statement was described by a leading QC, not involved in the case as: “a breathtakingly intellectually dishonest judgment.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2003: It emerged that 2nd death was from bacterial infection
<ul>
<li>In a second appeal, Sally Clark was freed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2005: Meadow was struck from medical register
<ul>
<li>2006: reinstated by appeal court — misconduct fell short of “serious”!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Meadow was in effect assuming, without evidence, the absence of family-specific genetic or social factors that make cot deaths more likely in some families than in others. Why was Meadow’s assumption of independence not challenged in the 1999 trial? Issues of whether or not different pieces of evidence are independent are surely crucial to assessing the total weight of evidence. Meadow had only enough understanding of probability to be dangerous.</p>
<p>Sally Clark was finally acquitted on her second appeal in 2003, with her sense of well-being damaged beyond repair. The forensic evidence had been weak. The web page has a helpful summary of the statistical issues. It quotes a study that suggests that the probability of a second cot death in the same family is somewhere between 1 in 60 and 1 in 130. Even after this adjustment, the probability of death from natural causes of two children in the same family is low. But so also is the probability that an apparently caring mother from an affluent middle class family, with no history of abuse, will murder two of her own children. Those are the two probabilities that must be compared. Anyone who plans to work as a criminal lawyer ought to understand this crucial point. In a large population, there will from time to time be two deaths from natural causes in the one family.</p>
<p>A small number of appeals were subsequently launched against other convictions where evidence of the same type had been presented, most of them successful. A further consequence was that the law was changed such that no person could be convicted on the basis of expert testimony alone.</p>
<p>The <span class="citation">Watkins (<a href="#ref-watkins2000conviction">2000</a>)</span> article “Conviction by mathematical error?: Doctors and lawyers should get probability theory right” provides a trenchant critique of the perils of allowing non-statisticians to present unsound statistical arguments, with no effective challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guidelines for using probability theory in criminal cases are urgently needed. The basic principles are not difficult to understand, and judges could be trained to recognise and rule out the kind of misunderstanding that arose in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watkins, who was at the time Director of Public Health for Stockport in the UK, argued that the calculation of the relevant probability should have had no regard to the probability of an initial cot death. It surely has some relevance. The basic principles are perhaps more difficult than Watkins was willing to allow.</p>

<p>The paper <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-reinhart2010growth">Reinhart and Rogoff 2010</a>)</span> has been widely quoted in support of economic austerity programs internationally. There was a huge stir, in the media and on the blogosphere, when graduate student Herndon found and published details of coding and other errors in the results that RR had presented.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>As well as coding errors, Hendon identified selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics. There was no consideration that the relationship studied has varied substantially by country and over time. Half of the 20 countries had missing data for 5 or more of the years, with the largest number missing in the years 1946 to 1949.</p>
<p>In response to <span class="citation">Herndon, Ash, and Pollin (<a href="#ref-herndon2014does">2014</a>)</span> and other critics, Reinhart and Rogoff accepted that coding errors had led to the omission of several countries, but pushed back against other criticisms. Their revised analysis addresses only the most egregious errors in their work. Among other issues, their insistence on treating each data point for each country as an independent piece of evidence makes no sense. The smooth curve fitted in Figure <a href="#fig:debt2gdp12">7.1</a> may be regarded as an average over the ten countries, but as Figure <a href="#fig:debt2gdp-3">7.2</a> shows, with huge country to country variation.</p>

<p>Thirteen days after it was published on May 20 2020, three of the four authors withdrew a paper that claimed to find that malaria drugs, when used experimentally with patients with Covid-19, led to around 30% excess deaths. Irrespective of the problems with the data that will be noted shortly, serious flaws in the analysis ought to have attracted the attention of referees. There was inadequate adjustment for known and measured confounders (disease severity, temporal effects, site effects, dose used).</p>
<p>The study claimed to be based on data from 96,032 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from six continents, of which 66% were from North America. Very soon after it appeared, the article attracted critical attention, with a number of critics joining together to submit the <span class="citation">Watson et al. (<a href="#ref-watson2020open">2020</a>)</span> letter to Lancet.</p>
<p>The sources from which the data had been obtained could not be verified, data that claimed to be from just five Australian sources had more cases than the total of Australian government figures, and similarly for Australian deaths, there were implausibly small reported variances in baseline variables, mean daily doses of hydroxychloroquine that were 100 mg higher than US FDA recommendations.</p>
<p>Randomized trials designed to test the effectiveness of the drugs, and that were in progress at the time when the paper appeared, were temporarily halted. The eventual conclusion was that the drugs did not improve medical outcomes. There was some evidence that hydroxychloroquine could have adverse effects.</p>
<p>With current web-based technology, randomized controlled trials can be planned and carried out and yield definitive answers, in much the same time as it would take to collect and analyze the data that are required for an observational study whose conclusions can be, at best, suggestive. Data confidentiality issues are easier to handle in the context of an RCT.</p>

<p>Consider a father whose height is 72 inches, which is the 95th percentile of heights for fathers. What is a best guess for the height of a son? One can read the predicted value off from the graph (the solid horizontal line in Panel A). Or use the regression equation. Or, reason thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the correlation between father’s height and son’s height were 0, the best guess would be the mean for son’s, i.e., 68.7 inches</li>
<li>If the correlation were 1, the son’s height would be the 95th percentile of heights for sons, i.e., 73.3 inches.</li>
<li>But, as the correlation is 0.5, the expected height is 68.7 + 0.5<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>(73.3-68.7) = 71.0 inches, i.e., start at the mean and move 0.5 of the distance up to the 95th percentile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now consider a son whose height is 73.3 inches (the 95th percentile for sons). The argument now goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best estimate of the father’s height is 67.7 + 0.5<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>(73.3-67.7)=2.8 inches, i.e., start at the mean for fathers and move 0.5 of the distance up to the 95th percentile.</li>

<p>Regression coefficients may differ greatly depending on what adjustments are made for other variables. This is important for attaching meaning to a coefficient. For the hillrace data that will now be considered, it is relatively easy to tease out the role of the explanatory variables that have been included in one or alternative versions of the regression equation. Especially where there are three or more explanatory variables, with the manner in which they should enter into the regression equation is unclear, the effect of an individual variable that is of interest can be difficult or impossible to tease out.</p>
<p>The hillrace dataset has record times for 23 Northern Ireland Mountain Running Association hillraces, as given in the 2007 calendar. In the models fitted and graphs shown that follow, the distance measure is <code>Dist</code> (distance converted to kilometers), the climb measure is <code>Climb</code> (vertical distance between lowest and highest point, in meters), and the time measure is <code>Time</code> (in minutes).</p>
<p>How does time per unit distance (<code>timePerKm</code>) vary with distance. We will fit two equations, both with <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> = <code>timePerKm</code>.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:partial">8.6</a>A shows the dependence of <code>timePerKm</code> depends on <code>log(Dist)</code>, when <code>log(Climb)</code> is held at its mean value. Use of <code>log(Dist)</code> rather than <code>Dist</code> means that distance on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis from 2 to 4 (km) is the same as from 4 to 8, or from 8 to 16, or from 16 to 32, i.e., equal distances correspond to equal multiplicative changes.

<p>In Panel A, time per kilometer decreases quite sharply as distance increases.

<p>The United States National Hurricane Center began formally naming hurricanes in 1950, a task now under control of the World Meteorological Organization. Female names were used for Atlantic hurricanes from 1953 to 1978, with a mix of male and female names used from 1979 onwards.</p>
<p>In a paper titled “Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes”, <span class="citation">Jung et al. (<a href="#ref-jung2014female">2014</a>)</span> used data for 94 Atlantic hurricanes that made landfall in the United States during 1950-2012 to argue that death rates from those with female names were overall higher than for those with male names. The suggestion was that where names were female, authorities took the risk less seriously. The paper attracted wide interest on the blogosphere, with female hurricanes jokingly called herricanes and males called himmicanes.</p>

<p>The separate dotted lines in Figure <a href="#fig:hurricanes1">8.7</a>, red for female and blue for male, are a close equivalent to the authors’ fit to the data. Notice the use of a relative (numbers of deaths) scale on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis, and a dollar scale on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis. An unfortunate consequence of the use of a linear dollar scale on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis is that the slopes of the lines are strongly influenced by the final four points at the upper end of the scale. Why did the authors not use, at least as a starting point, the same relative scale on both axes, as in Figure <a href="#fig:hurricanes2">8.8</a>?</p>
<p>As well as using a relative scale on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, Figure <a href="#fig:hurricanes2">8.8</a> uses a methodology that allows the data to determine the form of the response. Deaths do on average increase more at a higher rate than the damage measure, but not at the rate suggested by the dashed curves. There is now no evident difference between the two curves.</p>
<p>Jung et al omitted <code>Audrey</code> (in 1957) and <code>Katrina</code> (in 2005), as outliers.

<p>Creationist Barry Setterfield has argued that a reduction over time in the speed of light has led the passage of time to slow down, relative to the remote past, so that the universe is thousands rather than billions of years old.

<p>Observe that 1964 was the last year in which the global temperature fell below the average to that time. For the 52 subsequent years (from 1965 to 2016 inclusive), the global average was above the average up to that date. Under the (false) assumption that global temperature is varying randomly (and therefore independently) about a common mean, the probability of this happening is 2<span class="math inline">\(^{-40}\)</span> = 9.1 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 10<span class="math inline">\(^{-13}\)</span>. A variation of this argument came from a speaker on the Australian ABC Science Show on April 3 2011.</p>
<p>Under any model that accounts for what are now fairly well understood patterns of correlation over time, the probability, while very small, is not that small! Arguments that overstate the case for what is now a well-established pattern of change are unhelpful</p>
<p>It is likewise nonsensical to fit a line to the cherry-picked years 1998-2008, where the trend was relatively flat. Year to year temperatures are correlated.</p>

<p>To be credible, scientific claims must be able to survive
informed criticism. The nature of the critique that is
needed will vary, depending on what is in question.
It will vary, at a broader level, depending on whether
what is in question is</p>
<ul>
<li>Measurements
<ul>
<li>e.g., as in astronomy, distances to other planets,
stars, and galaxies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>or the results of an experiment
<ul>
<li>e.g., showing that plants grow better when compost is
added to a nutrient deficient soil</li>
</ul></li>
<li>or a theory, such as Newton’s law of gravity or laws of motion.
<ul>
<li>A theory is a model that is designed to describe natural
phenomena. A theory in conceptual, relying on entities
such as electrons and waves that lie outside of normal
human experience, where a law is a mathematical description
of observable phenomena.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Large parts of science, and scientific applications, rely on
models that in turn build on scientific theories/laws.
<ul>
<li>Epidemiological models have been crucial to informing
New Zealand’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Climate models are an example of very complex models. These
rely on
<ul>
<li>The basic laws of physics, fluid motion, and chemistry</li>
<li>Knowledge of the way that atmosphere, oceans, land
surface, ice, and solar radiation interact to change
climate.</li>
<li>Computer simulation to build in the effects of areas
of uncertainty.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Measurements and experimental results must be replicable
— i.e., another experimenter must be able to repeat the
experiment and obtain the same results. Theories must
be able to make successful predictions.</p>
<p>In areas where results depend on the sharing of data and
skills between different scientists and groups of scientists,
the critique that authors provide to the work of their fellow
authors will commonly ensure that what is submitted for peer
review is soundly based.</p>
<p>For experimental studies that are designed to stand on
their own, the past decade has seen the emergence of
concerning evidence that a large amount of published
work is, when put to the test, not replicable. The
steps needed to implement change are well understood.
The slow pace of reform is disappointing.</p>
<p>More generally, uncritical and faulty statistical analyses,
such as have been documented earlier in this book, are a
cause for concern. Too often, model fitting becomes a ritual,
without the use of standard types of diagnostic checks that
would have demonstrated that the model was faulty.<br />
<span class="citation">Stark and Saltelli (<a href="#ref-stark2018cargo">2018</a>)</span> comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mechanical, ritualistic application of statistics is contributing to a crisis in science. Education, software and peer review have encouraged poor practice–and it is time for statisticians to fight back.
. . .
The problem is one of cargo-cult statistics - the ritualistic miming of
statistics rather than conscientious practice. This has become the norm
in many disciplines, reinforced and abetted by statistical education,
statistical software, and editorial policies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not just statisticians who should be fighting back, but all
scientists who care about the public credibility of scientific
processes.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> What results can be trusted?<a href="#what-results-can-be-trusted" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Scientific processes work best when claims made by one scientist
or group of scientists attract widespread interest and critique
from a wider group of scientists who understand the work well
enough to provide informed and incisive criticism. This can be
an effective way to identify claims that have no sound basis.
Examples are the May 2020 Lancet and New England Journal of
Medicine studies, claiming to be based on observational data,
arguing that use of the drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment
for Covid-19 was increasing patient deaths.<br />
Issues with these papers were quickly identified because they
made claims that bore on an issue of major concern, and attracted
attention from readers who carefully scrutinized their detailed
statements. They were quickly retracted. How much that has no
sound basis does that attract such attention, and is never
challenged?</p>
<p>Heavy reliance on the sharing of data and skills, and full use of
the benefits that modern technology has to offer, have been vital
to progress in such areas as earthquake science, the study of
viruses and vaccines, modelling of epidemics, and climate science.
This sharing of data and skills, and use of modern technology, also
helps in the critique of what has been published earlier.
Areas where there has not been the same impetus for change are much
more susceptible to the damage that arises from systems for funding
and publishing science that encourage the formal publication of
what would better be treated as preliminary results — a first
stab at an answer. Publication of experimental results should not
be a once-for-all event, but a staged process that moves from
“this looks promising” to “has been independently replicated”,
and to post-publication critique.</p>
<p>Publication does not of itself validate scientific claims,
Rather, as stated in <span class="citation">Popper (<a href="#ref-popper_1963">1963</a>)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observations or experiments can be accepted as supporting a theory (or a hypothesis, or a scientific assertion) only if these observations or experiments are severe tests of the theory – or in other words, only if they result from serious attempts to refute the theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The demand that experimental results are shown to be replicable is
central to effective scientific processes. As <span class="citation">Fisher (<a href="#ref-fisher_1937">1937</a>)</span> wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No isolated experiment, however significant in itself, can suffice for the experimental demonstration of any natural phenomenon . . . In order to assert that a natural phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable we need, not an isolated record, but a reliable method of procedure.</p>

<p>Fraud, though uncommon, happens more often than one might hope.
What is disturbing is the small number of scientists with
large numbers of papers that were retracted on account of
fraud. How were they able to get away with publishing so
many papers, usually with fraudulent data, before the
first identification of fraud that led to a checking of all
their work? Ritchie <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ritchie2020science">2020, 67–68</a>))</span> cites,
as an extreme example, the case of a Japanese anesthesiologist
with 183 retracted papers.</p>
<p>More common are mistakes in data collection, unacknowledged
sources of bias, hype, mistakes or biases in the handling of
data and/or in data analysis, attaching a much higher
degree of certainty to statistical evidence than the results
warrant, and selection effects.</p>
<p>What gets published can be strongly affected by selection
effects. There may be selection of a subset of data where
there appears to be an effect of interest, choice of the
outcome variable and/or analysis approach that most nearly
gives the result that is wanted, and so on. In analysis of
data from experiments where two treatments are compared,
the common use of the arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(p \leq 0.05\)</span>
criterion as a cutoff for deciding what will be published
has the inevitable effect of selecting out for publication
one in twenty (or more) results where there was no difference
of consequence.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>At the time of his death in 1997, Eysenck was the living psychologist
most frequently cited in the peer-reviewed scientific literature.
Much of his work was controversial in its time, with papers
containing “questionable data and results so dramatic they beggared
belief” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-o2020famous">O’Grady 2020</a>)</span>. He relied heavily on what has now been
identified as heavily doctored data that was supplied to him by
German collaborator Grossarth-Maticek. Particularly egregious was
the claim that individuals with an identifiably cancer-prone personality
had a risk of dying from cancer that was as much as 121 times higher
than that of people with a “healthy” personality — one of several
links that the duo claimed to have found between personality and
mortality. Investigations into Eysenck’s work, including
collaborative work with Grossarth-Maticek, are ongoing. Fourteen
papers have been retracted, and another 71 have received
“expressions of concern”. A large replication study conducted in
2004 found none of the claimed links, apart from a modest link between
personality and cardiovascular disease.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>In a book published two years before his death, Eysenck made
comments that provide an intriguing insight into his thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists have extremely high motivation to succeed in discovering the truth; their finest and most original discoveries are rejected by the vulgar mediocrities filling the ranks of orthodoxy. .. . . The figures don’t quite fit, so why not fudge them a little bit to confound the infidels and unbelievers? Usually the genius is right, of course, and we may in retrospect excuse his childish games, but clearly this cannot be regarded as a licence for non-geniuses to foist their absurd beliefs on us. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-eysenck1995genius">Eysenck 1995, 197</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eysenck was alluding to claims that Newton had manipulated data, and
suggesting that it was excusable for other “geniuses” to do the same.</p>

<p><span class="citation">Roberts et al. (<a href="#ref-roberts2021common">2021</a>)</span> identified an astonishing 320 papers and preprints
that appeared between 1 January 2020 to 3 October 2020, and which
describe the use of new machine learning models for the diagnosis of
COVID-19 from chest radiographic (CXR) and chest computed tomography
(CT) images. Quality screening reduced this number to 62, which were
then examined in more detail. None of the 62 satisfied these more
detailed requirements, designed to check whether the algorithms used
had been shown to be effective for use in clinical practice. Among
other deficiencies, 48 did not complete any external validation, and
55 had a high risk of bias with respect to at least one of
participants, predictors, outcomes and analysis. A significant number
of systems were trained on X-rays from adults with covid-19 and
children without, so that they were likely to detect whether the
X-ray was from adult or child, rather than whether the person had
Covid-19.</p>
<p>In an account of the results that appeared in New Scientist,
<span class="citation">Roberts (<a href="#ref-roberts2021AIcovid19">2021</a>)</span> comments that, relative to persisting to
develop a model that will survive a rigorous
checking process and might be used in practice, “it is far easier
to develop a model with poor rigour and [apparent] excellent
performance and publish this.” This is a damning indictment of
the way that large parts of the research and publication process
currently work. The public good would be much better served
by a process that encourages researchers to persist until it
has been demonstrated that researchers have a model that meets

<p>The critiques have limited relevance to areas where the nature
of the work forces collaboration between scientists with
diverse skills, widely across different research groups.
Where all data and code used in modelling are out in the open
for all to see and evaluate, and research requires co-operation
internationally across multiple areas of expertise, ill-founded
or exaggerated claims are unlikely to survive long. Differences
in the extent to which the nature of the work force co-operation
go a long way to explaining the large variation that is evident
in standards for published work.</p>
<p>Experimental results that have not been independently
replicated should be treated as provisional, awaiting
confirmation. Replication provides an indispensable
check on all the processes involved. If there are gaps
or inaccuracies in the report and/or supplementary
material that make it impossible to replicate work,
this soon becomes obvious. Another research group,
especially one that has developed expertise in
checking over the work of others, will not usually
repeat the same mistakes.</p>
<p>The peer review process does at least impose some minimal
checks on what is published. In some cases, issues
may be identified subsequent to publication. The case is
at least better than for claims made by those who promote
“alternative medicines”, nowadays often on the internet,
offering “evidence” that is anecdotal.</p>

<p>The evidence that human induced greenhouse gas emissions
are driving global warming has for the past two decades

<p>The tobacco industry has made extensive use of “the science is
not settled” arguments in its efforts to dismiss the evidence
that smoking causes lung cancer. The same PR firms, and the same
researchers used to support these efforts were later used in the
attempt to undermine climate
science.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a>
The goal has been to raise doubt, create confusion, and undermine
the science.</p>
<p>In spite of the support that has been available from the fossil
fuel industry for research that is critical of mainstream climate
science research, no substantially different alternative account
has emerged, and no climate change models have emerged that give
results that differ widely from the consensus. Richard Muller’s
Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study (BEST) is interesting
because Richard Muller had been known for his climate skepticism,
in part based on legitimate scientific concerns. A large part of
the funding came from the right-wing billionaire Charles Koch,
known for funding climate skeptic groups such as the Heartland
Institute.</p>
<p>Muller made headlines when he announced his acceptance of what
climate scientists had been saying for more than 15 years previous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After years of denying global warming, physicist Richard Muller now says “global warming is real and humans are almost entirely the cause.”<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>The broad sweep of work in climate science is, because it has
survived informed critique, and because of the diversity of
contributing skills and data, unusually secure. Details,
especially as they affect what may happen in individual
countries, are subject to continual revision.</p>
<p>A particular issue is the role of the greenhouse gases, and of
their interactions with water vapour. Their direct effect is
greatly magnified by the consequent warming of the air in which
water vapour is present, allowing it to retain more vapour and trap
more heat). A standard denialist trump card has been to claim the
authority of scientists who have standing in their own areas for
the claim that the contribution of greenhouse gases is small
relative to that of water
vapour.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a>

<p>Between 1999 and 2019, opioid deaths in the United States increased
by a factor of six, to almost 50,000.
A large contributor has been the increased use of prescription
opioids. Purdue Pharma stands out for its aggressive marketing of
oxycodone, sold under the brand name OxyContin, arguing that
concerns over addiction and other dangers from the drugs were
overblown. In September 2019, Purdue Pharma declared bankruptcy,
facing significant liability in OxyContin and opioid addiction
lawsuits. Details of settlements are still being worked in the
courts.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

use for purposes for which they have not received formal
approval, and for a time stayed under the radar.</p>
<p>Another scandal that demonstrates how drug companies can
sometimes work their way around the approval process
concerns the drug Vioxx, likewise marketed as a
painkiller.<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-valentine2007timeline">Valentine and Prakash 2007</a>)</span> Concerns that the
drug might be increasing the risk of heart attacks began
to emerge in the months following its approval for use
in May 1999. By November 1, a study set up to investigate
these concerns reported 79 heart attacks out of 4000
among those taking the drug, as opposed to 41 among a
comparator group that was taking naproxen. The drug
continued on the market as the evidence against Vioxx
strengthened further. It was argued, with no evidence
to back this up, that naproxen likely had a protective
effect. In any case, why allow Vioxx to go to market
when naproxen was clearly carried less risk.</p>
<p>In September 2004,
when a colon-polyp prevention study showed that Vioxx
increased the risk of heart attack after 18 months,
Merck withdrew the drug. A Lancet paper that was
published later estimated that between 88,000 and

<p>One may hope that checks on any new drug will be
stricter than was the case for Vioxx, that lessons
have been learned, that where in future drugs come
up for approval, checks will continue on possible
long-term effects. With fringe and quack medicines,
there are no such checks.</p>
<p>One can take encouragement from the way in which
evidence of the type discussed, that one other drug
is doing more harm than good, has in the cases
discussed finally come to light. They illustrate
the importance of collecting the relevant data, and
of taking note of what the data have to say.</p>
<p>It has been interesting to follow approval processes
for Covid-19 vaccines. At the time of writing, the
Pfizer, Astrazena and Moderna vaccines have had, in
addition to their testing in clinical trials,
extraordinary levels of testing in clinical practice,
with risks that are small relative to the small risk
that we take ever time we cross a busy road. The
trials, and the use of these vaccines in clinical
practice, have been unusual in the levels of scrutiny
that they have attracted from experts worldwide.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>“The ‘us versus them’ narrative”<br />
The powers that be are trying to deceive us.” Ask who is
making the real attempt to deceive — commercial interest groups,
peddlers of quack treatments, influence peddlers, . . .</li>
<li>‘I’m not a scientist, but…’<br />
Meaning perhaps: “I’m not a scientist, but that does not stop me
making an authoritative pronouncement that flies in the face of
established results.” Or: “I know what the science says, but
I’m keeping an open mind”. Politicians are among the most
frequent offenders.</li>
<li>Reference to ‘the science not being settled’<br />
Much science is of course not settled, and one can then
expect scientists to openly argue different points of view
based on available evidence. Or, what has come to be accepted
wisdom, may turn out to be wrong or in need of substantial
revision. Challenges to the accepted wisdom have, however, to be
carefully argued, and themselves survive informed critique.</li>
<li>Overly simplistic explanations<br />
Oversimplifications and generalizations are central to many
anti-science arguments. Science is often messy, complex and full
of nuance. The truth can be harder to explain, and sometimes
sound less plausible, than a simple but incorrect explanation.
Simplistic statistical arguments are common, e.g., fit a
line to world average temperature data for the cherry-picked years
1998-2008, ignoring year to year correlation as well as influences
that operate over longer time periods.</li>
<li>Cherry-picking<br />
One is not entitled to choose one study over another just because it aligns
with what you prefer to believe. This is not how science works.<br />
Not all studies are equal; some provide much stronger evidence than others.
The way that choices are made has to stand up to critical scrutiny.</li>

<h2>2. <span class="math inline">\(^*\)</span>What does a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value tell the experimenter?<a href="#pval" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-values are widely used to indicate whether a difference. What follows introduces technicalities that have been avoided in the preceding chapters.</p>
<p>Consider an experiment that compares a treatment with a control. For example, does taking a drug of interest reduce sleeplessness? The starting point for a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value calculation is the NULL hypothesis assumption of no difference in effect between treatment and control. A <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value measures the probability that a difference in measured effect as large as that observed, or larger would, assuming the NULL hypothesis, occur by chance. The definition says nothing about the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value that can be expected if there is a difference. It does not give, as is sometimes thought, the probability that there really is no difference.</p>
<p>Issues for understanding the meaning of a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding <span class="math inline">\(p \leq 0.05\)</span> is all very well. What one really needs to know is that there is an alternative that is substantially more likely.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p = 0.05\)</span>, or close to 0.05, is at the upper end of the range of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values that occur with a probability of 0.05. Treating <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.05\)</span> as an event that occurs with probability 0.05 under the NULL exaggerates the evidence that it provides against the NULL.
<ul>
<li>In fact, under the NULL, all values between 0 and 1 are equally likely!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prior probabilities matter. If for example the data is from one of a set of drug trials where 99 out of 100 can be expected to show no effect, the 99 out of 100 instances where there is a 1 in 20 change of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> &lt;= 0.05 have to be set again 1 out of 100 instances where there is a potential to detect an effect. A <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> &lt;= 0.05 is more than 99/20 = 4.95 times as likely to come from a drug with no effect as from one that has a real effect.
<ul>
<li>What size of effect is, based on whatever is known from past comparable investigations, likely? A reasonable default is to center the distribution on zero, with values that become increasingly less likely as the distance from zero increases. Under plausible assumptions of this general type, it can be shown that with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>=0.05, the prior relative likelihood should be multiplied by, at most, around 2.5.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></li>

<h1>About the author<a href="#author" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>For the major part of his career, John Maindonald has worked with other
researchers as a quantitative problem solver.
He has held positions at Victoria University of Wellington, in DSIR, in HortResearch Crown Research Institute (now Plant and Food), and at The Australian National University (ANU).
He joined the then newly formed ANU Centre for Bioinformation Science in 2001, formally retiring in 2005.
<!-- Since formal retirement in 2005, he has been a visiting fellow in the ANU Mathematical Sciences Institute. -->
Between 1983 and 1996, and occasionally after 1996, he reviewed the statistical content of numerous papers that appeared in DSIR (later, Royal Society) journals, notably the New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research and the New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Research.</p>
<p>Between 2003 and 2015, he fronted 35 short courses (one week, or less)
across different parts of Australia that demonstrated the use of the open source R data analysis and graphics system for data analysis purposes.
<!-- These were conducted at the request of, or under the auspices of, a variety of Australian and other academic, research, and government organizations. -->
He is the author of a book on Statistical Computation, and the senior author of
the texts</p>
