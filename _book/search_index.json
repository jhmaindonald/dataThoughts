If points are numerous and there is substantial overlap, use open symbols, and/or use symbols that have some degree of transparency. Different choices of color palettes are effective for different purposes. Bear in mind that the eye has difficulty in focusing simultaneously on widely separated colors that are close together on the same graph. 2.2 Varying time intervals — show rates, not counts A graph that was essentially the solid segmented solid line in Figure 2.1 appeared in National Science Foundation (1975) “Science Indicators, 1974”. The segmented line gives a highly misleading impression for the four years 1971-1974, as opposed to earlier points, where numbers are totals over decades. It joins up a final point that is a different measure from earlier points. The gray dots, and the axis on the right, show rates per year, thus comparing like with like. Figure 2.1: The black line shows numbers of US Nobel prizes, for given time intervals. The gray dots. with the right axis label, show average per year. The same principle applies for intervals of measures other than time — for example of length or volume. 2.3 Banking — the importance of aspect ratio Figure 2.2: The same data are used for both graphs. The pattern that is not obvious in Panel A is very obvious in Panel B Patterns of change on the horizontal scale that it is important to identify should bank at an angle of roughly 45o above or below the horizontal. Angles in the approximate range 20o to 70o may be satisfactory, and the aspect ratio should be chosen accordingly. 2.4 Scales that show changes by equal multipliers Figure 2.3 shows two plots of the same data. Panel A plots brain weight (grams) against body weight (kilograms), for 28 “animals”. Panel B plots the same data, but now equal distances on each scale show changes by the same factor (i.e., change in relative weight). Figure 2.3: Panel A plots brain weight (grams) against body weight (kilograms), for 28 ‘animals’. Panel B plots the same data, with relative weight scales, i.e., equal distances on each scale show changes by the same multiplier. Often, when measurement data span a large range (e.g., a change from smallest to largest by a factor of 100 to 1 or more), it is a relative amount scale that is appropriate.1 2.5 Different graphs serve different purposes The line in Figure 2.4A shows the broad overall pattern, while Figure 2.4B shows how that pattern needs to be tweaked to more closely reflect the data. Figure 2.4: Panel A plots world record Time (as of 2006, in minutes) against Distance (in kilometers), for field races. On both the x and y axes, the scale is one on which equal distances on the scale correspond to equal relative changes. Panel B plots deviations from the fitted line in the y direction, otherwise known as residuals, against Distance. The deviations are approximate relative differences from the line. Thus a 0.05 difference is a difference that amounts to 5% of the time predicted by the line. Notice, in Panel A, the use of scales for which which equal distances on the scale correspond to equal relative changes. This is achieved by specifying logarithmic scales, on both axes. There is a loglinear, i.e., straight line on logarithmic scales, relationship. In Figure 2.4, the line looks to be a good fit. The range of times is however large, from just under 10 seconds to close to 11.5 hours. All except the largest difference from the fitted line are a less than 7% change, and are not at all obvious in Panel A. There is a very clear pattern of systematic differences in Panel B that reflects differences in human physiology, very likely between the athletes who excel at the different distances. The line can be interpreting as implying a 13% increase in the time per unit distance for every unit increase in the distance. The units may for example be units of 100 meters, or kilometers. Panel B indicates that the pattern of increase moves down to a local minimum at around 200 meters, up to a local maximum at around 1 kilometer, down again to a local minimum at around 20 kilometers, and then steadily up again. Relative distance scales Figure 2.5 shows different “equal physical distance along the scale” labels that might be used for the relative Distance (“logarithmic”) scale in Figure 2.4 in Subsection 2.5. Figure 2.5: Different labelings, all with tick marks at the same relative distance apart, are shown for the Distance scale. The multipliers for the Distance values that are plotted are, starting at the bottom, 2, 4, 5, and 10. 2.6 Helpful web links are: Good &amp; bad graphs (Ihaka, lecture notes)2 Misleading graphs3 Color Brewer4 Chapter 3 Selection and survivor bias Placeholder 3.1 The hazards of convenience samples Convenience samples sometimes have a story to tell 3.2 UK cotton worker wages in the 1880s 3.3 The uneasy path from hindsight to insight Tales of standout past success 3.4 The message in the missing bullet holes Chapter 4 Medicine and health Placeholder 4.1 Useful sources of advice and information The Harding Center for Risk Literacy Harding Center Medical Fact Boxes The Cochrane Center[^04-medical-4] 4.2 Randomized Controlled Trials vs other study types Randomized Controlled Trials — the gold standard?

About the author For the major part of his career, John Maindonald has worked with other researchers as a quantitative problem solver. He has held positions at Victoria University of Wellington, in DSIR, in HortResearch Crown Research Institute (now Plant and Food), and at The Australian National University (ANU). He joined the then newly formed ANU Centre for Bioinformation Science in 2001, formally retiring in 2005. Between 1983 and 1996, and occasionally after 1996, he reviewed the statistical content of numerous papers that appeared in DSIR (later, Royal Society) journals, notably the New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research and the New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Research. Between 2003 and 2015, he fronted 35 short courses (one week, or less) across different parts of Australia that demonstrated the use of the open source R data analysis and graphics system for data analysis purposes. He is the author of a book on Statistical Computation, and the senior author of the texts Data Analysis and Graphics Using R — An Example-Based Approach, Maindonald and Braun, Cambridge University Press 2010.

A logarithmic transformation is used to obtain such relative distance scales.↩︎ https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/\\~ihaka/120/Lectures/lecture03.pdf↩︎ https://www.statisticshowto.com/misleading-graphs/↩︎ https://colorbrewer2.org/↩︎ Lancet, May 2020, https://bit.ly/3xqncMt↩︎ "]]
