# Regression and Correlation {#sec:reg}

Yule-Simpson type effects, discussed in Section \@ref(sec:yule1)
["Explaining the Yule-Simpson Paradox"], are important in a 
regression context also.  Nonsense correlations that arise 
where the third variable is time provide simple examples.

## What direction does the correlation go?

Variable A may cause variable B.  Or variable B may cause
variable A.  Or  both A and B may be caused (or driven) by
a third variable C.  Cases where the third variable is time,
as in Figure \@ref(fig:socAnti), are a fruitful source
of examples of spurious correlations.^[Figure \@ref(fig:socAnti)
is one of many such examples that are available from  
<http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations>.]

Examples of this type help highlight how correlation can and
cannot reasonably be used.

The following examples, where third variables are likely to
be involved, are from [@nisbett, pages 133-134].

1. Children of parents who try to control eating are more likely 
to be overweight.
2. Countries with higher IQs have higher average wealth measures.
3. People who smoke marijuana are more likely to later use cocaine.
4. Ice cream consumption & polio were closely correlated in the 1950s.

Kahneman argues, perhaps too simplistically: 

* Height is mainly due to genetic factors
* Sons share half their genes with their fathers
* Hence, correlation between sons' & fathers' heights $\simeq$ 0.5

Galton's 1886 data, which predates Pearson's data, shows a 0.46
correlation between child height and the average of the parent
height.

### Kahneman's comments on regression to the mean {-}

"Extreme predictions and a willingness to predict rare events from
weak evidence are both manifestations of System 1. ..."  
"Regression to the mean is also a problem for System 2. The very idea
... is alien and difficult to communicate and comprehend.  This is a
case where System 2 requires special training."  
"We intuitively want to match predictions to the evidence."  
"We will not learn to understand regression from experience."

### The Sports Illustrated cover "jinx" {-}

The 21 January 2002 issue of Sports Illustrated featured an 
[article on the so-called The Sports Illustrated cover jinx]
(https://vault.si.com/vault/2002/01/21/that-old-black-magic-millions-of-superstitious-readersand-many-athletesbelieve-that-an-appearance-on-sports-illustrateds-cover-is-the-kiss-of-death-but-is-there-really-such-a-thing-as-the-si-jinx)^[<https://vault.si.com/vault/2002/01/21/that-old-black-magic-millions-of-superstitious-readersand-many-athletesbelieve-that-an-appearance-on-sports-illustrateds-cover-is-the-kiss-of-death-but-is-there-really-such-a-thing-as-the-si-jinx>]
After examining covers that had appeared from 1954 to 2001, they found that

> Of the 2,456 covers SI had run, 913 featured a person who, or team that, 
suffered some verifiable misfortune that conformed to our definition--a Jinx
rate of 37.2%.

[Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated_cover_jinx "2021-03-24")
has very detailed comments on the phenomenon.  Especially in contact sports,
athletes who do exceptionally well will have been pushing their bodies to the
limit, with a high risk of injury.

> Most athletes that seemed to suffer the jinx most typically 
suffered because of an injury to their body, or some other bad 
luck following their appearance.

Athletes appear on the cover of a magazine such as "Sports Illustrated"
when they are performing unusually well, both relative to their fellow 
athletes, and relative to their own earlier performances.  They are
likely to be approaching their peak, and/or to have experienced an
unusual run of luck.  Where chance effects are the main driver,
their success is likely to be temporary, quickly dropping back to close 
to or below their longer term average.  Some of those who feature will
be at their peak, and will on that account soon drop back.

The Wikipedia article notes a number of athletes who went on to do
exceptionally well following appearance on the cover.  Standouts 
were the basketballer Michael Jordan (50 covers)Â and Muhammad Ali 
(40 covers). These were outstanding athletes that consistently
outperformed others.

## Moderating subjective assessments

* Estimate average
* Make assessment, based on what evidence seems to suggest
    + Assessment is based on current measure
* Estimate correlation between current and predicted measure.
* The correlation determines the fraction of the distance
to move from the average to the assessment.

e.g., Correlation of shotput with long jump is close to 0.4

* 14.9 meter put is at the 93nd centile (7% will do better)
* Long jump mean = 6.97; 92% mark  7.47 (difference=0.5)
* Estimate long jump result as 6.97+0.4 $\times$ 0.5 = 7.17

### Forecasting sales {-}

You are the sales forecaster for a department store chain.  
All stores are similar in size and merchandise offered,
but random factors affect sales in any year. Overall sales
are expected to increase by 10% from 2020 to 2021.  Sales
in 2020, with the expected total and mean for 2021 are,
in millions of dollars:
    
Store | 2020 | 2021
----- | ---- | ----
1 | 10 | ---
2 | 23 | ---
3 | 18 | ---
4 | 29 | ---
TOTAL | 80 | 88
MEAN  | 20 | 22

Assuming that year to year correlation is around 0.4,
what is a reasonable estimate for sales in each of the
stores in 2021.  The mean sales amount in 2021 is predicted to be 22,000,000 dollars?
With a correlation of 0.4, the predicted sales for the individual stores are
obtained thus:


Store | 2020 | Subtract 20 | Xply by 0.4, add to 22 | Predicted sales
----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
1 | 10 | -10 | 22-4 | 18
2 | 23 | +3  | 22+1.2 | 23.2
3 | 18 | -2  | 22-0.8 | 21.2
4 | 29 | +9  | 29+3.6 | 32.6
MEAN  | 20 | 0 | 22   | 22

### Choosing from job applicants {-}

Correlation between presentation & performance is likely to 
be lower for the less well-known.  In both cases performance 
is likely, relative to presentation, to move in closer to the
mean. For less well-known candidates, the shift towards the
mean is likely toÂ be greater.

### Secrist's "The Triumph of Mediocrity in Business" {-}

Horace Secrist's 1933 book was based on annual data for 1920 to 1930:

* 73 different industries; examine ratios
    + Profits:sales; Profits:assets; Expenses:sales; Expenses:assets
* For each industry in 1920: split firms into 4 quartiles: top 25%, ...
    + Took average for each statistic, for each quartile, for each year.
    + Surprise, surprise, the best went, on average, down ...

"Complete freedom to enter trade and the continuance of competition
mean the perpetuation of mediocrity.  ...  neither superiority or
inferiority will tend to persist. Rather, mediocrity tends to become
the rule."

### "Do old fallacies ever die?" {-}

Smith gives references to work by prominent economists in the past
half-century that had quoted Secrist approvingly or repeated his error.

* 1970: "The book [by Secrist] contains an elaborate statistical
demonstration that, over a period of time, initially high-performing ..."
* 1980s investment textbook: "Ultimately, economic forces will force
the convergence of the profitability and growth rates of different firms."
This was backed up with a 1980/1966 Secrist type comparison.
