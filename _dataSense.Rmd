<!-- ### Paul the psychic octopus -->

<!-- Prior to UEFA Euro 2008 matches, and again prior to 2010 FIFA World Cup, -->
<!-- Paul was presented with a choice between two clear plastic boxes that -->
<!-- were marked with a flag, one for each of the opposing teams.  Each -->
<!-- contained a mussel or an oyster. The flag on the box which Paul first  -->
<!-- chose (eating its contents) was deemed to predict the winner of the  -->
<!-- match. There was no allowance for a draw.  Figure \@ref(fig:paul)  -->
<!-- compares Paul's 'predictions' with the outcomes.   -->

<!-- ```{r paul, echo=FALSE, fig.pos="h", out.extra="", out.width="90%"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("pictures/paul2.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The predictions proved correct for four out of six matches in 2008,  -->
<!-- and for all 8 matches in 2010.  Was the positioning of box random? -->
<!-- Did Paul show a preference for a box on one side or the other?  Was -->
<!-- Paul attracted to the patterns of horizontal stripes of flags -->
<!-- from Germany, Croatia, and Spain;  did they appear similar to stripes -->
<!-- on an animal that was a food source? -->

<!-- David Wootton argues that science as we know it had its beginnings in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.  Lorraine Daston, in a Guardian review, argues that Wootton places too much weight on the literary evidence. -->

<!-- Dating back to Archimedes and earlier, there'd been a long tradition of tradespeople, experimentalists, and mathematicians (Wootton does discuss these) whose work and insights developed pretty much independently of a philosophical and theological tradition that valued the statements of Aristotle (who was, ironically, himself an experimentalist) above the evidence of their own eyes. -->
